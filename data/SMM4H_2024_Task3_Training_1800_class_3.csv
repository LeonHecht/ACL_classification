3z5vqi,"outside, walk"," I've developed social anxiety since moving to a foreign country.. Back in my home country, I did not have this debilitating sense of dread whenever I needed to go outside. I have lived in Asia and went to an international school since the second grade. I had a lot of confidence in myself, as well as a decent group of friends. I still wasn't the most social guy, but I had friends I could relate to. I was able to go to malls, shopping centres, cafes and what not, and converse with the cashier/waitress as a normal person would, although I was a bit awkward. Since then, I've moved to the UK for my undergrad, and man I've basically become a shut-in here. I am too shy to make friends with the local students, I feel like my english despite being good enough is different from the way its spoken in Britain, hence whenever I try to start a conversation, my sentences tend to be incomplete and simply words strung together without a proper structure. My self-esteem has suffered deeply because of this. It's been a year and a half now, and its not getting any better. I'm feeling a mixture of denial and knowing that I shouldn't feel this way because I could function normally back home, as well as anger at myself because I just can't help myself to get out of this condition. I refuse to acknowledge that I have a problem, and I keep looking for reasons as to why I might be the way I am now. Here's how my daily life feels like to me: I leave my apartment complex and walk to university. On my way, I feel that everybody is looking at me, judging me for being so awkward and lame. Once I get to the lecture rooms, people are conversing outside, talking to each other while waiting for class to start. I see people I've talked to before, but for some fucking reason I decide not to make eye contact and sit/lounge around alone. I take out my phone, hoping that nobody notices that I am a loner. I walk into the class, and am greeted by the sight and sound of hundreds of students in this massive lecture hall. I try not to make a fuss about it but I am actually panicking about where I would be able to sit down, without attracting attention to myself. I finally find a place and a couple of people in a group decide to sit next to the empty spots next to mine. They're talking, having a lot of fun, asking each other about how last night's party was and what not. And I'm just there, probably they're oblivious to me even being there. Once lecture finishes, and classes are done for the day, I immediately walk back to my room. This walk back is often filled with bitterness and intense feeling of loneliness, as I pass by other students walking with their friends. The worst part of all this is that I can't figure out why I am the way I am now. Why could I function normally, and live without fear back home but once here I'm afraid of the outside world. I'm afraid of the eyes that aren't probably even looking in my direction, of the laughter I hear around me, thinking that it must be at my expense, while simultaneously knowing that it isn't. I am stuck and I don't know why. ",3
3zfg86,"outside, walk","New around here, but not to anxiety.. Hello there! I am new to reddit, I felt it was a good move to make so I could learn about and finally feel calm, knowing that I am talking to people who take this sort of thing seriously. I'll give some background... I am a 16 year old male. I have suffered from social anxiety/phobia for the past 3 or 4 years. I have no idea what went wrong or where. I used to be able to go the shop on my own, but now... I don't even go there. I am too scared. Even in broad daylight... I am petrified of going. I don't know who I'll bump into or whatever. I think my anxiety is because I am fearful of what people are capable of. I am a very weary person, and I trust no-one to begin with. I really dislike it when someone says it's just because I'm shy. NO. It's not. You don't quite know how I feel. This is more than being shy. It's fear. I have never been one to make a fuss of anything. I have never been the 'class clown', I have only been in one detention (that was for forgetting a ruler in maths, lol) and I haven't been to the headmasters office. I feel a bit like Elliot from Mr. Robot if anyone knows what that is. I DESPISE going outside in urban areas. I cannot stand densely populated area. My parents often ask me if I want to go on a walk with them and the dog. All too often, I say no. It's not because I'm lazy; rather fearful of who's outside and who might see me. I almost hate everyone at school. Except from a few people. People I associate with. People I know and can trust. Trust has also been a big issue with me. At this moment in time, the only people I trust enough are 2 of my friends and my family. My mum is very supportive. (Not saying my dad isn't, it's just that my mum is the first port of call for me) Like I say, I never leave the house unless it's completely necessary. Maybe I hate society. I stay inside other than when I have to go to school. I hate parties. I hate crowded areas. I cannot speak on the spot if someone questions me about something. I just freeze and stutter... just pushing any old bull**** out of my trap. On a weekend, I spend probably 1/2 of my day in my room. Doing stuff on my computer or just playing games. Enough rambling on. I'll just break down my diagnosis into bullet points for the most relevant things... I cannot make eye contact I hate going outside. I dislike most people at my school I sit at my computer neigh on all day doing stuff I shouldn't be doing I cannot speak in front of people I do not know This one I HATE. If I saw someone getting bullied, hurt or anything, I would probably do nothing because I would be too scared to do anything about it. I CANNOT HELP THIS!! I am a very, very, very, very, very, very, private person. Words can't express how private I am. No-one knows much about me. (Except for family, obviously). No-one externally if you will. I am trying to get a visit into my GP. Even for this I'm too scared! :(",3
430v9h,"swimming, swim", Swimming. I've gotten it into my head that I want to go swimming for a couple of weeks but.. you know.. people. I don't want to be forced to swim in the same lane as other people and to swim past them (in opposite direction so awkward eye contact ot award looking away). I even asked the place when they have the least amount of people there. They said around lunch. Last night I had managed to convince myself to go but I couldn't fall asleep and my throat is itchy. I still have a sore or itchy throat but it's not that bad and I'm trying to decide if I should go swim tomorrow or not (if I can fall asleep) Anyone regularly swim? How do you do it? Certain times and days when there's less people? Don't care if theres a lot of people? ,3
48evrw,park,"14 years old... Daily Social Anxiety. Hello. My name is Jacob and I hope I am posting this in the right spot. I'm 14 and I believe is have had social anxiety for pretty much my entire existence so far. Let's take it back to preschool. I remember looking at myself and always thinking ""I'm fat"". I know I was young, but I was extremely skinny, but all I saw was fat when I looked down, and actually tried to keep it a ""secret"" from school and my family.i guess the next instance started around 3rd grade. That was the summer after my great grandma died. She used to live next door, and every day I thought about seeing her. She was an amazing woman that I miss so much. After she passed, I felt at loss for quite a while. The year after, bullying started kicking in. I actually became overweight, really saw no difference than before. I was teased for being fat, or stupid, or told I ""liked boys"". I pretty much felt no need for social interactions any time after that. I know I was young, but of course that shit still happens today to me. As of my current situation, doing almost anything social wise is difficult. The best way I can describe it is like a huge amount of embarrassment before the actual event. But it's really worse than I am describing it. It feels like any action I take in some sort of social area (school, restaurant, store, park, ect.) someone there is either watching me do it and thinking badly of me, which I hate, or I am constantly going over in my had be bad things people will say to me. Confrontations are another big issue for me. If I want something, I would rather miss out than ask for it. It makes me feel like I am burdening someone else's life for my own needs, and that they might think badly of me. This ranges anywhere from asking my brother to help me with homework to even just asking someone to point me in the direction of the soup isle in a store. It is also very difficult for me to do anything social wise that could result in me screwing up, even tho 90% of the things that get to me have a 0% screw up rate. This anxiety has gotten to the point where I cannot even enter a grocery store alone out of fear that someone is watching me (although when I am forced to, i always use self checkout) so that is most of my anxiety. I really haven't told anyone how I feel about this before tonight, so I Hope you enjoyed reading about my problems... Have a nice night or day everyone",3
4noqzx,"runs, run, running","Crippling fear of exercise may actually cause me to get type 2 diabetes. Hi, first post on this sub. I'm Butter, how are you. Alright anyway, my family is at an extremely high risk for type 2 diabetes. Runs in the family or whatever. I'm pre-diabetic at age 18. Gym teachers made fun of me when I ran in elementary school. I was always the last kid in the grade to finish. The humiliation I felt when everyone was watching me panting and wheezing, cheering me on to finish the last lap of the yearly mile at age 10 really screwed me up. They had no ill intentions, I was just so embarrassed. I don't run. I can't do it and I hate every minute of it. I don't exaggerate at all when I say that I would rather be marked as skipping every single day of the week and serve out all detentions than run the mile at school. I don't run. A few years back I got the majority of my spine fused. I have no flexibility from the end of my neck to just above my lumbar. I don't know how I look when I try to exercise or dance, I just feel *weird*. Like I can't move without looking jerky and awkward. Because of this, my belief that everyone is staring at me all the time no matter where I am, and my fear of running, I don't exercise in public at all. I would exercise at home, but I know my parents will make fun of me. The have no ill intentions but they aren't able to hold a conversation about anything without making fun of it. Trying to have them stop will result with them getting defensive and argumentative, so I'm not doing that. If I ever exercise, I do it when nobody is home, in the basement with the doors locked. Times like that are rare, so sticking to a schedule is hard. How do I exercise without having what little mental comfort I have left falling to shambles?",3
4nxxon,walk,"how to walk?. this is seriously my worst symptom when it comes to social anxiety. As soon as I get around a crowd of people, or even go into a store, I start walking idiotically. At first I thought it was just me who thought about it, but I've had a few friends call me out, as well as one time having a guy mimick me walking as we were walking past him. My one friend described it as me walking like I'm trying to hide something, with my arms hugging to my sides and not really swinging them. its horrible that at 22 I still can't walk like a normal person. I often think it may have to do with how skinny I am. I think I feel like people are judging me and I go into self defense mode.",3

It was triggered due to a couple major close deaths one right after the other; I don't know how to handle grief. ..and a continuous sexuality assault situation that really left me in a self loathing, self conscious mess. It would take me to go into complete detail but I'm going to explain some things quickly to get to my point. It has gotten to a point where I can not hold face to face conversations. I am afraid to even leave my bedroom in my own home that is shared by just me and my very supportive boyfriend. I am afraid to go outside or even apply for jobs because I know I won't get through the interview and if I do even make it that far I leave the job or get fired because I just stop showing up. I'm at a complete loss. I feel like I have absolutely no control over anything. I feel like an empty shell and that scares me. I do convince myself to leave the house but only if my boyfriend is with me. He has become a crutch that I just don't want to drop.

4x23rs,"outside, walk","Struggling to get myself outside again. To start things off: i'm 21 years old, i've been a shut-in since i ended highschool (4 years now...) and i'm struggling, really hard, to start something up again. Mostly out of anxiety and fear. God .. okay. So i became a shut-in after some personal issues, including trying to figure out what the hell was going on with my life... having a huge fear of failing things and getting nervous about anything social. I remember my mother telling me that it's just shyness in general but i knew that it was way different, it wasn't shyness, it was actual fear. I'm always been a little bit afraid of everything that i'm doing. An obvious thing is the pressure of being interesting and not a bore around others. Another one is cooking for others: it feels like they expect me to do at least a good job, but if i mess up i get a hard anxiety attack and start crying. And if i'm tasked to do something for someone, like a job task, which i'm paid for, i think about it in circles before i even do it, and i imagine what things could go wrong, and how i should do it perfectly, or else i picture people around me laughing or making fun out of me. I was kind of teased that way while growing up... Anyways, things like going outside, making phone calls, interacting with strangers all day makes me feel terrified and sick to my stomach. Work makes me anxious. I'm absolutely afraid of starting to work, even though i know i should. I feel like a leech to my parents. I just can't bring myself to start working, because it seems to be this huge terrifying place where people are yelling at me what to do, and if i mess up i'm going to be punished, in the social sense. I have this screwed up idea of how the world works, even though i haven't been outside... at all. It's like something i rely on and believe is true even if i agree that the world doesn't work that way. It's hard unsticking myself from it... This is rambly. Anyways, the stupid thing is, if i force myself to go outside, and for example, take a walk... then after i'm done with it it doesn't feel that bad. I feel, okay, i can handle this, this wasn't as bad as i thought. So clearly i just have to force myself out to experience it even if it wrecks me. It's still really difficult. While inside, shielded from the outside world, a (figurative) voice in the back of my head tells me that the outside world is still scary, and the times i've been taking a walk doesn't matter. I feel like i'm completely submitting myself to the inner fear, 'ego', whatever whenever this happens. It tells me that i should feel scared, and worry about things, and think ""what if""... it fools me in to thinking that it's for my own best. I can recognize this yet i feel powerless to change it. Until i actually take the first step, which feels like the hardest thing in the universe, and it dissolves right in front of me. I recently did an experiment with my boyfriend, where, when he would be brutally honest and criticize my bad habits (which i'm thankful for) i would stop fighting and just ""give up"", something i fear a whole lot. Whenever someone would criticize me, i would feel a need to fight back, in order to prove myself, to not be seen as weak, or whatever. I gave up and admitted that i was wrong, and it gave me such a relaxed feeling that i have never felt before. It felt like i could finally relax my muscles, and stop worrying about what he, or other people thought about me, and as a consequence i didn't feel any social anxiety, or any anxiety for that matter. I think this 'ego' is the root of the problem, making me worry about behaving in a ""good"" way, so that people will like me. This makes sense as when i was a child/teen, people used to avoid me for some reason. So at least i have something to work with. I hate worrying about things way too much, i hate thinking about things in circles before even doing something, i hate thinking i know how it's gonna play out even if it never does. I never am right in my predictions and yet i think it's the safest way to go. It's stupid. I wish i could do something as simple as getting a job, and handle my own life, but i can't. It seems too daunting and i worry way too much about messing up and looking stupid. My english is dumb i'm sorry",3
4z2aaq,running,"Comforting Myself in Times of Extreme Depression. Things are really bad for me right now. Yesterday I came to the realization that I think I'm actually at peace with the thought of suicide. Made a previous post about it. People always say try to find a hobby, which I already have I listen to music 24/7  and wanted to be a singer my whole life. But obviously I'm still suicidal with that. It's gotten so bad for me that I surround myself with little things that are comforting to me even in the slightest. A few good examples: The smell/ taste of carmex, myrrh incense, roasting pecans, the smell/ taste of tobacco. Little things like this, I was really sad earlier so I was smearing carmex all over my hands  and mouth like a psychopath freak.  and I don't smoke anymore because its an expensive thing  and I'm broke but even when I was little before I ever once smoked there was this one restaurant I loved because half of the place was a smoking section. My favorite place to go when I was little,  and afterwards my clothes would smell like smoke  and I loved it. I feel like I would love to go running but my social anxiety is the worst with that kind of thing. I had like 8 cups of tea earlier because that's really comforting to me... I am so weird. But I am in a very dark place right now I'm doing everything I can. EDIT: Oops I'm an idiot. The reason for a lot of this is because I'm trying to email follow up on a few job applications. I am so bad at thinking what to say  and I'm convinced I won't hear back anyway.",3
501tbo,"walk, outside","Anxiety with people of my age.. Whenever I'm walking outside (mostly with my dog), I can see people of my same age or most likely adolescents (I'm 15). Even if they are completely into their business I feel like they might look at me, and say something into their heads, or worse... To their friends next to them. You know, I'm skinny and feel horrible, and they are most of the times better looking than me, and it makes me feel reaaaally bad. I try to avoid eye contact and I can't tolerate less than 100 meters between us. I don't know why I'm less anxious when facing adults, little kids or elders, but I think it's because I compare me to them, and see many differences. It wasn't always like this... It began to be a real thing a bit after the start of high school. When I was in the class, there were these two guys that looked at me like they were facing a monster. I even realized after a moment, that when one of them came at me and tried to be ""FRIENDLY"" (or an asshole) he grabbed my arm trying to be stealthy (obviously I noticed it immediately), and after finishing he went away. That, just to feel the girth of my arm. That built my social anxiety. Before it, I could wear anything without being bothered by how I might have looked and how much of me was shown to others. For this, I love cold seasons, so I can cover my body as much as I like without looking weird and generate comments like: ""Oh my god, aren't you melting?!"". In fact, I'm extremely anxious just thinking about going back to school... I really hope someone will come talk to me, and if they do, I hope they don't limit it to just a ""Hi"".

I would just like to hear people's opinion on this topic. I'm 21 and I've been struggling with severe anxiety problems for the last 4-5 years. This uncomfortable feeling has been going for so long that I can't even remember the last time I felt totally comfortable. The only times I feel more or less relaxed is when I'm locked in my room and don't have to see or talk with people. Whenever I go outside I'm unable to calm down and act natural. I become very self-conscious and paranoid about other people. It's almost like an automatic switch inside of my brain that unleashes all these negatives thoughts that overwhelm me, stress me out and infuriate me. This makes me very defensive and hostile-looking which pushes other people away. I have a permanent frown on my face, I can't smile or show any emotion other than anger. This makes it impossibe for me to make friends or approach women. I wish I could just be myself without having to feel any shame about what other people may think about me. I hate having to act aggressive all the time but I just can't control this ****** anxiety. Can anybody else relate to this? If so what should I do to relieve this anxiety? Thank you",3
55qwj6,"walk, outside","Do I have social anxiety?. I'm not sure if I have social anxiety or just am introverted. Here are some things about me: When I'm walking outside in public, WITHOUT a friend, I get self conscious and anxious, which causes me to walk faster and take routes with less busy streets. My main fear when I'm in public is that I will meet or be noticed by someone I know, causing them to make false assumptions about me depending on my location and situation. E.g if someone sees me walking in a bad neighborhood, I'm afraid of them assuming I'm a criminal When I am in public WITH a friend, however, it's much easier and I get less anxiety. I freak out when I am called on by the teacher to read or present in front of the class. When my class is taking turns reading out loud, I will quickly skim through the paragraph before everyone else to prepare in case I get picked to read next When I present to the class, I stutter and can't keep my body still (moving my hands excessively, walking around, etc.) Unless they are my close friends or family, I stutter and tend to look down when I'm having a conversation with another person. I get anxiety when making or receiving phone calls. When I receive a call, I ignore it and later text the person saying that I was busy I reread my emails and make revisions several times before sending them. When I want to say something out loud to another person or a group of people, I repeat the sentence in my head a few times to make sure the wording doesn't sound wrong. I hate standing up in class, whether it's to go to the restroom or to give something to the teacher. When I'm talking to someone, it helps to stand a couple of feet away from them. I'd love to wear a hood and thick clothing to feel secure, but I can't due to fear of being judged for what I wear. Talking and interacting with girls is significantly harder than with guys When my family is going somewhere, I make an excuse not to go, such as homework. I have an unreasonable fear of having bad breath. I brush my teeth before I go out to social events, always keep sugarfree gum with me, and avoid eating sugary food to prevent bad breath. I can make myself LOOK confident if I try, but it's difficult. During lunch, I'd rather sit with others than sit alone to avoid looking like I don't have any friends. I don't have a license yet, but I don't think I would be able to drive at all because of the pressure. I could never sit in a plane next to a stranger I was never bullied in my childhood but I had a friend who would make me feel unworthy and less than others I have a loving family and my parents, who I look up to, are not shy at all I was not like this until I became 13 y/o I'm apologize if this was a long post.

5hi7gl,"outside, park","What is this? (x-post /r/Anxiety). Decides to put this here because I only got one response. Anyway, here goes: I feel like some kind of imposter here, I haven't been diagnosed with anything, but I know there is something wrong with me. Where to begin... So, I think I could be described as a quiet, shy, introverted (I know being shy and introverted are two different things), and reserved person. I always have been, so far, at least. I'm 15. It goes a little further than that though. I'm incredibly socially awkward, and I really don't know what to say a lot of the time. If a conversation dies out, I feel like it's all my fault because I'm not interesting. I've avoided Skype calls with a close friend numerous times because of this, and I feel like every time I decline a request to call, they'll stop being my friend. Like they'll hate me or something, even though I know that's bizarre. Also, I have friends I've met online that I've known for well over a year now, and I even feel uncomfortable talking in calls with them, so I usually lie and say that I can't talk right now, and just type instead. I also hate going outside, ever since I was a kid. My sister loved(s) going to the park; I didn't want to, I wanted stay inside all day, but my mum made me go. But recently it's gotten worse. A lot worse. I took a day off school two weeks ago. I pretended to be sick. Long story short, I'm not exactly in a happy place right now, and I just couldn't go in. Fake smiling, fake laughing - I was sick of it. Then there's also, what I can only presume, are panic/anxiety attacks (quickened breathing, shaky hands, tight throat). Which is kind of why I'm here. I've only ever had one of these (I think) months ago, way back at the start of 2016 in my house. And that sucked like hell. Now I've started to get them at school. They usually occur just after a maths lesson has finished. I just get this overwhelming feeling of fear, and all I could think was ""What the fuck is wrong with me? I need to get out of here now,"" and ""There's nothing wrong with you, it's all in your head; man up."" ""Man up"" - that phrase has been drilled into me. After the bell goes and we get to leave, I usually go straight to the toilets in one of cubicles and stay there for 5-10 minutes (during break/lunch break) to calm down. Then I have to leave so I don't look weird and my friend(s) ask me where I've been. That brings me to today, I pretended to be sick again today to have the day off. Same reasons - unhappy and panic/anxiety attacks. I also feel constantly uncomfortable in social situations (so, all 6 hours of school. Yay), I have a big fear of judgement of others and base my self-worth on that - which is why I have very little of that, but also self-esteem and confidence. I only ever feel normal (mostly) when alone, and even then I'm thinking how I have to get up at an absurdly early time in the morning to go to a school I hate and talk to people when I'd rather shut myself in all day. Weekends are a goddamn blessing; I get to sleep the day away. I'm amazed how I've managed to even keep two friends and have them both even like me enough to want to talk and hang out with me. There's clearly something not right but I'm not sure what. I've taken two days off school because of people...I know that sounds pathetic, but that's because I probably am. Am I over-dramatizing this? I should also add that no one else in the world knows about this except me (duh), a close online friend, and well, you. Anyway, thanks for reading.",3
5l9428,"walk, run, soccer"," High school baggage (self-therapy; long rambling). I'm trying to work through some stuff in my own head, so no one needs to read or reply to this. I visited my high school on the pretext of seeing the new renovations, but I actually just wanted to feel like I could walk everywhere without fear. Even though I graduated five years ago, I still felt nervous. Even though the school is on winter break and campus was empty, I found myself hesitant to walk where there were usually people. Even five years later, my automatic reaction was to walk away the moment I thought I heard someone and to put on my practiced facial expression as if someone were watching me. I was still scared to walk around campus, but I made myself do it (albeit there was no one there), telling myself that this is my campus too, that I didn't have to run away and that I have a right to be there. High school was about hiding. During lunch, I sat behind pillars and bushes, in bathrooms, classrooms and locker rooms. I walked quickly from class to class with my head down. I stayed in a corner in the library as much as I could. I didn't have a single friend in high school in spite of my initial efforts to reach out to people. I joined a soccer team; I quit because of the name-calling. I joined voice lessons; I quit because of the name-calling. On my first day of class in my first year, someone came to sit next to me, but his friend pulled him away saying loudly, ""I'm not sitting next to *her*."" These were all people I'd never met, I was totally new to the school district. In math class, my table group never worked problems with me. Instead, they ignored me, talking to each other in another language, sometimes about me, not even realizing that I understood everything they said. A few times, I tried to sit with people during lunch, people I had met and managed to talk to in a friendly way during class, but they all got up and left together each time. Of course I had to save my dignity and stop acting desperate. From day one, I was marked as a pariah. I don't know why or how I became the constant outcast except that I was new to the district. But for four years, I couldn't eat before or at school. I developed a binge-eating disorder, which still comes up once in a while. I shut down and did nothing but academically-oriented work, never going to a social situation, except prom, which my parents forced me to attend. Those same people I had talked to before said I could join them, probably because it would be rude to say no outright. But of course they walked away and avoided me the whole event. Visiting the high school campus was painful. Objectively, I know that all of this is in the past and that I should be able to move on. But the reality is that the SA that I face every day is in large part due to the ostracizing and name-calling from high school. The past is still a living part of the present. I thought that by visiting campus, I could get some closure. Instead, it's dredged up all the stuff I try not to think about. The only thing I can say is that I can see a bit more clearly what my behavioral pattern is--hiding and making myself as invisible as possible because if they can't see you, they can't hurt you. But I've gotten so used to making myself as invisible and unobtrusive as possible that I can't make friends. I've never dated. The one time I mustered the courage to ask a guy to hang out with me, he invited his roommate to join, making it a group activity and proceeded to leave me with her. Writing that out makes me realize how calculated that was; that was actually quite mean. I'm always on the defense from people and their attention. But all of this isolation hurts. I'm hurting myself in the present because other people hurt me in the past and because I'm convinced that people will hurt me in the future. I don't know how I can try anymore.

I don't know where to start or what to say or how much to say but all I know is that I need help Long story short I moved countries for my boyfriend and a couple years later and I think I've gained some unhealthy habits and I have huge social anxiety now and feel completely vulnerable and alone and it's ruining my relationship as well as myself. Here is some more background info for anyone who may be able to give me any good advice, I would really appreciate it. I'm a 20 yr old female and I fell in love a couple years ago and moved countries for my boyfriend, we are still together and i believe things are much better than before. You have no idea how hard this move has been on me. I used to be so happy and outgoing and have my close few friends and old high school friends. I used to do my own thing, I used to be so independent. First let me say that I love my boyfriend incredibly and we both plan to spend the rest of our lives together and have a family, build our home and we are already working on our business together. It has been a couple years and I still don't know how to speak the language here. I do not have a car or a drivers license and I work from home. I feel I am so reliant on him for everything. I feel I am so needy and attached to him always. We spend every day together and yes we take our space but I wouldn't want it any different. Now with the crime etc here and with how I stand out we both aren't comfortable with me taking the bus let alone running in the area we live. This is another problem. I know a group of people that speak English and we sort of get along but I feel no matter what I do not click with any of the girls here. I have always had troubles being friends with girls though, they don't seem to take a liking to me and I've accepted that and continue to be as nice and genuine as possible. I used to have a bunch of guy friends but now that I am in a serious relationship ( I should note this is my first relationship ) I don't think that it is very appropriate to make close guy friends but I get along well with my boyfriend's friends though. With the language I've been excusing it and excusing it and Now that I live here I feel I have become shy because I hate being laughed at for not knowing the language, I get so much anxiety when we are out and there is lots of people and my boyfriend is talking to people I don't seem to recognize or know, or even people I do know and it's in their own language and I just close in and feel so alone and so invisible to everyone. I try to learn a bit but guess I get frustrated and shut down easily. I am forcing myself to pay for 1on1 private lessons though and I feel this is a huge block that is one of the main problems for me. I hate being the center of attention as well and I think that I am a very insecure woman now that I am in this relationship. The way I think about myself can at times be terrible, I'm great for overthinking and my poor boyfriend gets to deal with it all. I know that from a young age because of dad issues or whatever I have abandonment problems and although I think my boyfriend would never and know that he has never done anything behind my back involving another woman I still feel like I will lose him at times and I feel like i am not good enough. As you can probably tell I have serious insecurities about myself, what I believe are abandonment issues, social anxiety, a language barrier, I am too dependent on him, uncomfortable to walk the streets alone, a hard time making friends, a hard time even going out of my comfort zone, sometimes suffer from bouts of depression etc and it is hard on both me and my boyfriend. I broke down yesterday because I was holding it all in for so long and I didn't want my boyfriend to know because honestly he is so used to me crying I feel like it doesn't even phase him but he came in the room and I couldnt hide it anymore and he actually cried with me because he couldn't believe how I was feeling about myself etc. But today we went to an event and it was so overwhelming for me there was so many people and I started panicking inside and tried to keep it to myself but he sensed it and then as we were leaving I asked if he wanted to get a beer before we went to this other event (work) and he said no and that we had to go to that event right away but then he saw his friend opened a bar and we went to say hi and the guys completely ignored me and they all talked to eachother in their language and again it hit me and I felt so worthless to be standing there just looking at the ground trying to keep it together and then he asks me if we can have a beer with them and that stung because I just got turned down when I asked. We ended up leaving anyway and he noticed I was a little upset and I asked him about the beer thing and the friends who wouldn't even look at me and then he started getting pissed off and He makes this comment ""why can't we go just one day without it turning bad "" and I started crying and there was a point I was upset with him and said fuck you and had a short rant and he said ""you don't even try to get better"" ""I don't deserve this"" ""I can't even say hi to my friends"", he totally lost his cool and was yelling and speeding at times and I just kept fucking crying, he also asked why for once I can't make it all about me and even though i feel he took things way too far I understand and I feel like a peice of shit and am so upset with myself. Please why can't I be fucking normal again I feel almost trapped right now but when I'm good things are amazing but no when he tells me that stuff I just feel like it would be better if I just left for good. I am hurting so much. Please someone help talk to me I have no one to go to and he was the only one I poured my heart and soul to. He knows everything about me, but when he goes and says this I feel like he just doesn't care and I feel I'd be better off gone. But when I think about it he is my everything. He is all I have. I am nothing.",3
5zuane,"walk, running","What is it?. Hi, I'm a 22 year old male from the UK. It has just hit me that I might be suffering from some form of social anxiety. I know it's not something you can easily diagnose, as being shy is common and often just a stage in someones life, but I think it's more than shyness for me. I can speak to other people fine, and will smile at the barista or laugh with somebody if the situation is so, so I wouldn't class myself as shy. I can hold a conversation with a stranger well enough. What I think is my problem is that I always feel like I have to prepare myself before I go out. Regardless of how well I think I'm dressed, or whether I have a fresh haircut or whatever, I feel unready to be in the gaze of others if I'm not physically and mentally prepared. If I don't know that I'm being looked at/am in the presence of others or if I'm not prepared mentally to be looked at/to be in the presence of others, I feel very uncomfortable. Don't ask me what my mental preparation is, because I have no clue. My physical preparation is fairly normal for a young male, it's just the mental side. I also just always feel like I'm being watched when I'm walking in public. Like everyone I pass stares at me for a second longer than they do at other people, because I don't fit in. Truth is, I look 'normal'. I'm from an ethnic minority, but who the hell cares about that (especially at uni). I don't think I look particularly attractive or unattractive. The issue came to fruition in Uni, when I began to be out and about more generally. I was a bit overweight, but not by majorly so, and my self-consciousness with that made me hate being in public. I'd want to be out of sight as soon as possible, and it was like a massive burden was lifted off my shoulders when I'd reach my room. Since then I've lost a lot of weight so that I'm really like any other young adult male (if a bit on the skinny side, but that's because I'm into running), and yet the feeling of being out of place still hasn't changed. I'm still at uni (in my final year), and it has improved a lot. Losing weight helped, and generally becoming more comfortable with how I look. I think that was one of my major problems. I was very self conscious with my looks. I hated the way I looked with glasses because I thought it made me look even weirder, to the extent that I wouldn't wear glasses when my prescription is such that I should wear them all the time. I'd rather be basically blind and live in a blur than to look that extra bit weirder. That continued on for a long while, until I realised that it was affecting how people I knew thought of me because they'd pass right by me or wave at me and I'd blank them because I couldn't see them. That's different now, I think I've come to terms with my image. I look different, but I'm fine with that because we all do, and I'm no beast or whatever. I'm a lot more comfortable in public too and will go out even when I don't particularly need to, but there's still that something that makes me falter before I go out in the morning, and sometimes I don't even want to leave my room. That is what has made me think that there's something more to my condition than just having body image issues. There's no better feeling than getting back into my room and being out of sight after a long day at uni. I read somewhere that this is just a symptom of being an introvert, but I don't think I am your usual introvert. I enjoy meeting new people, and sometimes I really crave it. It's not social interactions that exhaust me, because I get this need to hide away after simply being out and having not even talked to anyone. So is this the right place for me? Do you think I have social anxiety issues? I don't think it is the body image issues that I've had in years gone by, but then again I've never really looked for professional help for anything like this. I don't know.. honestly I'd just be glad if there was someone else who had the same issues, someone that I could to talk to about them? Thanks for reading all of that. It's the first time I've ever actually typed out my feelings about it, and really is a relief in itself, so thanks for being a part of that even if there is nothing you can suggest.",3

I've fallen twice in two months, first time I sprained my ankle (I grade) and I did't know I had SA then, I thought I just had bad luck, but I found out a little bit later I'm suffering from this, idk how much, I think at least I suffer from a mild social anxiety. So I fell because I was distracted and anxious because there were people near me while I was training. And today I fell again, although I've been working on my social anxiety, I still get anxious, and here's the MISTAKE: I tried to fight it, I knew I was anxious, because I was training next to a restaurant and people could look at me, so I just kept going, like saying to myself ""SA isn't gonna stop me from training as the last time I fell"". Don't do that, I'm fucked up again, this time the wrist and the shin, I've learned that when I feel anxious it's better to fight it but mentally, and stop doing pakour, or whatever sport you may be doing, go to another place where you're alone, or just be there and fight anxiety, but stop training, don't jump and just try to snap yourself out of it, because you've to acknowledge this is an issue, this will disappear if you want to, but it takes time, don't rush it ",3

I can't join clubs because I also won't know anyone there, and if I do, it's usually an acquaintance and I don't want to bother them. It's even hard for me to go outside alone, because I feel like the world is looking at me and criticizing me, but I can't text many people because I'm so boring and don't have many developed areas of conversation. I can't even find a job because the act of going somewhere, telling how much of a failure I am but still begging for a job is humiliating. I've only been to one (who wasn't even hiring, my dad forced me to go) and I cried afterwards.

I was never really asked if I wanted to move but I also didn't think about living in other country and leaving everything behind as a big problem. First half of the year was a horror. I spoke to almost no one. I learned German for a year prior to moving to Europe and it was not enough for me to instantly make friends. Also, the last couple of years at school in Ukraine were pretty difficult for me, as I was constantly bullied. I was weak and skinny and didn't know how to protect myself. But even then, I didn't have any other problems outside school. So, back to Europe, from my first days here, I tried to speak to my new schoolmates as good as I could. But I also started to shield myself from people. Like, if I try to look unfriendly or dangerous, nobody will try to make fun of me. I behaved myself like this, when I was in public. It's not, like I was being impolite to people, but I tried to always have this ""don’t mess with me look"", if this makes any sense. However, knew country, new rules. I didn't have to be afraid of being attacked physically. Instead I couldn’t argue or counter jokes from my classmates. This time I was vulnerable not, because I was weak, but because I didn't know the language well. I also went to a second school simultaneously. My week looked like this: twice a week a returned home at 8pm, because of two schools, where I hadn't time to go home between them. The rest of time I had to study. My first winter holidays, which I spent back in Ukraine, were both a relieve and a horror. I had to go privately to a German teacher almost daily. In first summer I had about 3-4 teachers to prepare me for both schools. All this was awful, but stilly I had my friends at home and was overall happy. **Until one day it started.** I was going back from my German teacher (who was a really nice person, and who taught me really a lot grammar, that helped me immense with my German, so it's not like I totally hated learning German). But let's go back. So, I was going back from my ""class"". I was a usual way for me: just a bit uphill along the road towards the bus stop. Suddenly it was more difficult for me to breath and I felt like, if I would start breath more, people would notice it and, that I looked really awkward. After that, I drove back home and felt myself completely normal. But this situation repeated itself more and more during that summer. I started to notice the way I breathe even on my way to the teacher. I think, this is where it all started. As I was back in Europe, I started being conscious about how I move my feet or my arms. I was always aware of where I was looking at, how my lip was positioned. I didn't know how to look in people's eyes, whether I looked unfriendly etc. I still had no friends at European school, I haven't had any walks which I had constantly with my friends back in Ukraine. It looked like the kids where either going out the way I didn't understand or the didn't do it at all. Years went by, the only time I enjoyed my life, was when I had winter or summer holidays and was back in Ukraine. There I could talk to people, I even managed to make new friends, with whom I still have good contact. I just felt myself normal. After about 2-3 years later, I managed to tell my mother, that something was wrong with me. (It's not easy for a kid to admit, that something is wrong with his head! And I didn't have a good connection to my mother at that time) She took me to her psychiatrist. I was prescribed with some weak antidepressant. I guess I helped with my mood a bit, but it had done shit to my social anxiety. I just tried to suppress the way I felt and had from time to time breakdowns. My only dream was to finish school and University and leave that fucking country. Since no one here needed me, I decided, I would manage everything on my own. I finished both schools. It may sound like it isn't bad after all. Well, no. All this time it felt like I lost that autopilot and had to manually control the way I move, or where to look at the person I speak to. I still didn't feel connected to people around me. I could not make jokes, which the class would find funny. I didn't speak to anyone outside my class. I felt isolated and people around me perceived me the same way. I wasn't interested in my future carrier or, in what to study. My only dream was to leave this country. Instead of leaving, I thought, that it would be a waste to give up an opportunity to study in Europe. I also didn't want to disappoint my relatives. And, to be honest, I was afraid to change anything, go back home and take exams to be able study there. I also didn't want to look like an idiot, coming back, when everybody else wanted to leave Ukraine for better future. I think, I should have done that. If not for studying, but just to have a year off, relax, get rid of SA and may be come back to study. (It's important to mention, that most of the social anxiety symptoms weaken, after I get back home for, at least a month. But even from the first day on, I always felt myself a lot better ) But I haven't done that. Instead I thought, I could power myself thought University, get a bachelor and leave this fucking country forever. I tried studying two different faculties, I hoped, that at the University I would finally able to connect to new people and have fun (so that I would even decide to stay in Europe). That never happened. I tried to study mechanical engineering, but from the beginning the math was just unmanageable for me and I couldn’t find a group to study together. Well, if I can't have fun talking to someone new, since I am to anxious, I can't fit in a group to study, because you must speak there and, like, make friends :) In Europe there are no persistent classes at the Universities. You either have a lection in a huge auditorium or have smaller classes, with 20-40 persons for something like practicing math, where you must solve your prepared homework in front of whole group. I had to do it twice and I felt almost like I am fainting. The most time I spent at home, where I didn't have to feel constant fear and be in fight or flight mode. During one summer in Ukraine I met my current girlfriend. Later, I decided to study CS at a so-called University of Applied Science, where after three years of fixed classes I would have my bachelor and could go back to Ukraine. I had to wait almost a year to sign me up for that University. In the meantime, I found a job, where I am basically all levels of support and a junior sysadmin at same time. (Back in European school a had a specialization in IT because of which we had one year more of school. And the specialization made me hate IT so much, that I didn't realize, that I actually like it) The job was fantastic the only ""problem"" was, that every year in August they organized an event for different political, technical, economical, etc topics) and I had to be there for month. During that time I had both to do IT Stuff and help prepare everything for the conference (cheap student labor :D) But that one month of constant work (not 8/5) just crushed me. My anxiety escalated to some new levels, I was constantly stressed. I was still extra anxious after work but also looked forward to study something I wanted, the way I thought could be the best for me. I expected, that only mathematics would be hard for me, but I also knew you that it would not be as difficult as in a normal University. I was so fucking wrong about everything. The amount of information was huge. We had constant projects in most of the classes. Moreover, there are supposed to be a lot of group projects. The groups where created all by themselves. I didn't want to be that person without a group and be assigned to somebody I didn't like. All of this made me extremely anxious. Additionally, to my social anxiety I became anxious about everything else. I had to finish every assignment, otherwise I would fail either the final project or the test and then after 3 repeat I would have to repeat the semester. And if you didn't manage to do the first assignment, you will still have to do it, since every next assignment is built upon previous. But most important, I could not manage to make social contacts. I was truly afraid of people. It seems, like we have no similar interests. I still do not know how to connect to them. People in Europe just feel so alien to me. Here in Europe, at my University I felt like a totally different person. I had a lot of breakdowns, I started to cry in the evening and I somehow managed to survive till end of the December and have two weeks off, during which I had to prepare for math exam. But still I was in Ukraine with my girlfriend. What was really killing me is, that I still can perfectly speak to my Ukrainian friends, we can argue, discuss stuff, make fun of each other etc. I have a very nice and understanding girlfriend. I have no problems socializing with them. Or even with meeting new people in Ukraine. After final exams my girlfriend was here with me in Europe, and I still could not relax. When we were in public I constantly was afraid, that I cannot protect her, due to my SA. I also failed two exams and had to retake them after holidays, which made me even more anxious. My doctor gave me some new medication, which, for two weeks seemed to lower my social anxiety and it felt awesome. I already lost my belief that there could be any meds that could really help me. And that belief was restored. The only thing I feared, is that it won't hold, like with all previous things that seemed to help me. And, well, it didn't hold. Something happened during the weekends, I can't explain what it is. But it set me off. My fear became true. The amount of work for the University increased even more and became unbearable to me. At this point I cry for hours. Last week I spent home, constantly anxious. At this point, I don't know what to do. I should have left this country for a year after school. Now I feel, like I can't do it. I also feel, like I am already too old to stop studying and make a pause. I don't think, that I will be able to finish this semester, since I have already fallen behind all the classes. I also get very anxious if I try to study and more anxious after every minor difficulty. My relatives think, that it wasn’t that bad previously. I think, I just was very good at suppressing it and just can't take it anymore. When I felt myself worse, I was usually prescribed new medication, talked to the therapist. After that I felt a bit better and it was enough to continue suppressing and working on ""more"" important things. How long can a person live in a foreign country feeling lonely? I know, that there are people, to whom I am interesting, who like me and care about me. My family is also very supportive. But it's not them, who feel anxious about going outside. It's me who is constantly afraid of masses of people, who can't relax outside and can't protect myself from. Any verbal or nonverbal assault. It almost feels like I am at a warzone. I remember, when I didn't care, how people look at me, ignored if somebody was rude to me. I was able to respond the way I wanted. My head wasn't empty. Now I just slowly fall apart. I am not suicidal, I guess, because I don't believe in the afterlife and am afraid of death. Hell, I even was more relaxed during this two weeks in Ukraine in winter. It wasn't enough time, but I felt myself free on the streets. You probably gonna say, why the hell wouldn't I leave. I know, people would support my decision, I could probably come back later. But I don't won't to let down my girlfriend, even if she says, I don't. I didn't finish a university, so nobody would really want to have me work for them and I want to work, so that I won't be an abuse. I know my options. I just don't have the will to make a decision. I feel like I would get better a bit, like usual and would continue ignoring the problem and maybe in 5 years will slowly finish CS at the University. I just don't think, it is going to be a life. Maybe you together with my girlfriend, it would be easier. I don't know, why am I even writing this. I don’t know, whether it’s a right subreddit. Even posting something on the internet makes me anxious. I do not know, what I want to hear from you. Therefore, I will just share this story and hope for something. I also hope, I won’t be deanonymized by somebody. I just feel, like for the last 8 years, I lived only episodically, not being able to open my true potential or take the opportunities, I was given. And I feel like I am slowly going insane. I hope, that this text isn't totally unreadable, since I guess, English is not even my second language . I tried to keep it as short as possible, but I also don’t expect, that anybody would like to read almost 3k words text. **TL;DR** A lot of autobiographical stuff. Moving abroad as a kid literally ruined my nervous system as the years passed by. And my will was never strong enough to decide, what is really important for me and to change my life the way I really wanted. Now, I just can't take my social anxiety anymore and overcome any difficulties of being an adult. The difference between, who I am in one country, and who I am in another is just killing me.",3

8g2i0a,outside," ""Exposure Therapy"". So, after years of seeing different therapists and everyone recommending exposure therapy, I'm not really sure how this is supposed to help. Of course, I've never said this to any therapist because, well, I don't want to risk frustrating them lol. But yeah, there was even a couple of times where I went out with a therapist and practiced just being anxious in public. It sucked. And I'm told that after doing this enough times I should eventually feel better, but...I mean, I go outside every day and have been doing so all my life, only to feel terrible every day. So I just don't really know the point of all this. I'm sorry if this is really negative. Basically, I'm asking for a more hopeful outlook on all this or maybe some advice as to what else to try, if anyone has some. I'm aware of course that some people here complain of this sub being too negative so, I was kind of afraid to post this, but whatever. Roast me if you must; just kinda desperate for some hope. I want to change, but I still have a negative outlook on life and all, so maybe there's someone else out there who can interrupt my brain's negative lecture to me :\. ",3

8ivtuz,jog,"Had a Looming Realization Last Night. I've had this habit for a long time of drastically underestimating my anxiety. I'll make plans to do things, go on a jog, go to the store, etc. I know I'll have a lot of anxiety when I do these things, but... It is always so so so much worse when I actually do it. I heard a quote recently I don't recall where, something along the lines of ""Humans are a species so quick to forget hardships that they'll never learn."" Actually I'm pretty sure it was from one of the Hunger Games movies now that I think about it. After having went to the store last night with the plan of, while I was checking out at the register to ask if the store was currently hiring,  and having like, cardiac arrest levels of anxiety... I just really came to realize I need to be realistic  and try something else for awhile. I ended up not even asking I was just, insanely anxious well beyond my threshold. Instead I just silently filled the swear jar to the brim under my breath on the drive home. I have like, immense depression as it is. I feel I'm only worsening it day by day trying to scratch together the motivation to do shit like that. I've been to a total of 4 different therapist, at one point I even had 2 therapist at once sitting in the same room together with me. I'm sure it depends on the person, but for me I'd definitely say if anything therapy only worsened my depression. One thing that I have found some sense of solace in in the past is watching a few select people on Youtube just discussing there SA / Depression / Suicidal Ideation. I've thought about doing that for myself for a long time. I think it would be more beneficial to me then therapy which I stopped going to several months ago. I've basically been doing nothing with my time for the past several years. It would at least be more progressive then anything I've tried. If you can actually find somebody's videos you can relate to, as rare as that is, hell finding relatability with anybody whether you're both anxious/ depressed or not... It can be such a comfort having that. Actually listening to somebody talk  and not just reading a post makes it feel more real, like its not so much just all in your head. Do any of you guys watch videos like that, or even maybe thought about talking about your SA / Depression in a vlog yourself?",3

8mf3rh,"runs, park","My friends are little sick of me bitching about my social anxiety. TLDR: wall of text of me ranting and being a whiney baby. Sorry! ☹ And that's okay. I don't blame them because I can be super negative all the time. Once my social battery runs out, I'm extremely irritable and I've been known to throw a temper tantrum (honestly I'm a handful to be around). Going to California is definitely a major step in my journey of recovery but social anxiety still rears its ugly head. I'm only in Cali for a conference trip funded by my college so honestly I just wanted to be a hermit in my room. However, the other 3 students had plans to explore the city and then go clubbing right after. They were out until 3-4 am. And my god, I just looked at them, like how?? I was exhausted just thinking about. I'm only a few years older than them, too!! 😥 (is this an age thing? I'm only 25 and they'relike 21-22. Like they need to go outcause they're just turning 21 maybe?) I tried to keep an open mind about San Francisco...but I'm not a city person and the area I'm in really isn't the greatest. But I just want to go home! I did enjoy visiting the seaside area but it's so crazy since it's memorial day weekend. If it was less crowded and empty, I'd honestly would have enjoyed this trip so much better! However, the other students aren't familiar with how I am and it's a little exhausting to be around them. I tried not be too much of a drag on the group and I did enjoy what I've seen, but I needed my alone/recharge, BAD (I was on the verge of crying). The large crowds were making me super uncorfortable. Last stops of the day were the Golden Gate Bridge, the house from Full House and th Golden Gate park and I just couldn't. I ubered back to the hotel and safety. It was hard to tell if they just wanted me to enjoy the destinations or bothered by it. And it upsets me a little. I would of loved to enjoy California like they do. 😔 Social phobia/anxiety is awful. I keep texting my friends about but I know they're sick of it. It makes me a little sad that I don't have many people to turn to.",3
8ojsr4,"walk, riding"," I hate being watched or observed. Any advice for this?. I decided that I'm going to try to get out of my comfort zone. I went out for a short walk around my neighborhood just now. I notice I have this intense fear of being watched or looked at. During my walk I had cars riding by. I hate when cars ride by me because I feel like the person driving or the people in the car are looking at me and judging me. I had to walk near an intersection to get back to my house. I don't like when cars are stopped at an intersection and I have to cross, because I feel like everyone in their vehicles are staring at me and judging me. Judging the way I walk. Them sensing or noticing that I'm nervous or uncomfortable, and judging me for it. I also have a fear of catching my neighbors sitting on their porch. I didn't catch anyone sitting on their porch during my walk. However, I have these thoughts like ""What if I see my neighbors sitting on their porch? Should I say hello to them? Should I wave? What if they ignore me? What if I don't speak and they think I'm ignorant or rude? What if they think I'm weird?"" I don't like being observed by people. It makes me uncomfortable. Whenever my father observes me doing something he always judges or makes fun of the way I walk. He tells me I walk very stiff. Because of that I'm self-conscious of the way I walk. I always feel like people are judging the way I walk. He gives me a hard time and gets angry with me for looking nervous or uncomfortable when we're out sometimes. This is why I always feel like people can sense that I'm nervous and are going to judge me negatively. My father always tells me, ""You have to always watch your surroundings when you're out. You have to walk with your head up and your chest out. You can't appear weak or scared, because people will try to harm you if you appear vulnerable."" This is why I'm always a little paranoid when I'm out of my house or being watched by people, because I don't want them to think I'm weak and I don't want them to treat me like I'm nothing because of it or try to harm me. Sorry if this is all over the place, but all in all I hate being watched or observed by people. This stems from a lot of the things my father tells me. Any advice would be appreciated. ",3

8ugfyp,"walk, grass","My Social Anxiety. I wrote this as a bit of a vent for myself but thought I would post it here because I’m sure many of you can relate to this. It’s a bit long but here goes... As a kid I was always “shy.” I wouldn’t make direct eye contact with people most of the time. I would put my head down in situations where I had to meet new people. At family gatherings I would mostly keep to myself only talking to people if they asked me a question. Even then, it would usually be a short response. In school I didn’t have many friends. I had more in elementary than I did in middle school. More in middle school than in high school. I can count the number of real friends I had in high school on one hand. It sure didn’t help that I went to three different high schools throughout my high school years. One of those I left and returned to a few times. I changed elementary schools in the 4th grade, and then changed middle school in the beginning of 7th grade. So it didn’t make it any easier to make friends with people that already had established groups of friends that they had grown up with. I remember hearing this girl in my class talking to her friends about how it was weird that we keep leaving and coming back. (We being my sister and I) In high school people thought I was rude or mean because I didn’t talk to anyone. The truth is I just didn’t know how. I wanted to have friends. I didn’t want to be popular or anything but who doesn’t want to have their own circle of friends and people to relate to? Even the people I “dated” didn’t get to know the real me because I was too afraid to be myself. I don’t know why I felt this way. I’m sure it has something to do with my developmental years but I’m not an expert. Going to school every day was hell. Thinking that everyone is judging you all the time or talking about you or laughing at you is rough. Being made fun of for being “too skinny” or “too quiet” or “too rude” is rough. I would walk in every morning with headphones in and make a beeline for the classroom and I would leave the same way. I wonder if you know what this social anxiety feels like? It can come and go at anytime. Some days are worse than others. Some days it’s insomnia, heart racing, palms sweating, mind racing. It’s uncontrollable and it feels like you’re mind is going to explode from the craziness inside it. Some days it lurks in the background. On those days it’s manageable. You can go to the movies or to the mall and feel somewhat okay. Some days it’s canceling plans you’ve had for weeks because you just can’t bring yourself to leave the house and face human interaction. You can’t face the feeling of everyone’s eyes on you and the negativity that you assume is associated with you. You can’t force yourself to act like you’ve got it together in front of other people. It’s too hard to put on a smile and make conversation. The hardest part for me is self doubt. I’m always second guessing what I’m doing. Always thinking someone is watching. Always afraid of messing up. It’s also people thinking I’m lazy because I don’t work and when I do it never lasts too long. Even the job I have now which is a good job with good pay, it’s hard. It’s hard forcing myself out of bed in the morning knowing for the next twelve hours I’m going to be mentally exhausted which is much worse than the physical exhaustion. That may seem like an over statement to you but it’s not for me. Walking down the long walk ways at work hoping no ones walking the opppsite direction. What do I do when I cross someone’s path? Do I make eye contact? Do I look straight ahead? Do I smile? Nod? Wave? Am I rude if I just look down or away? These are all thoughts going through my head. As irrational as they are, they’re real. What happens when everyone is standing in a group talking? Do I go and try to be part of the group? But then I have to talk to people. But if I don’t I just look like a weirdo or like I think I’m too good to talk to them. What if I think I know how to do something at work but I’m not sure and I’m afraid to mess up so I ask someone for help? Then I feel dumb because I should’ve just done what I thought was right in the first place. Sometimes I avoid doing things altogether just so I can’t fail and look dumb in front of my co workers. But doing nothing also makes me look lazy and like I’m not a team player. Do you understand the problem? This is also the reason I don’t drive. I know I’m capable of driving and would probably enjoy it, but I’m terrified of taking the driving test. I can’t bring myself to go and be on the spot like that. I don’t even want to drive in front of my fiancé so how am I supposed to do it for a test in front of a stranger? Everyone tells me you need to get your license. It’s such an obvious and easy thing for everyone else but for me it’s the hardest thing in the world. It’s the same reason I wouldn’t cut the grass when I was younger. I didn’t want people to watch me out in the front yard anyone passing by could and I didnt want to mess up and cut it poorly. I hope this will help you understand what this anxiety is like for me. It’s not getting better. In fact it’s gotten worse. I’m getting more general anxiety now. Unreasonable worrying about things I have no control over. Checking to see if my loved ones are still breathing when they sleep or worrying about getting into car accidents. Living with this anxiety is getting harder and harder. All I want to do is give up and just lay in bed at home in a safe place all the time. I’m looking into getting help because this is too much to handle and I just want to feel normal for the first time in my life. Thanks for reading.",3
8v22wn,"walk, run","Does anyone get paranoid with more than one car driving behind you?. I just got my learners permit in May 2018 (at age 21). I’ve been slowly pushing myself. I, first, started driving, literally, down the block and back (on a quiet side street). My second time, I drove on a longer, but, still quiet side street and back. Third time, I drove at night around 11pm with my mom and went on roads with street lights, but stayed near my house. Fourth time (at 11pm), I drove by myself and drove farther than before. I’ve driven a few more times after that, but, I want to get to my main point. As with most of you, I hate large groups of people. When I see someone walking behind me on the same side of the street, I try to out-walk them or cross the street to avoid this anxiety. The same applies to driving. Today, I decided to drive on a busy-ish road during the day. I practiced my reversing and before I went inside, I did one run of going on a busy road during the morning rush. Boy, I haven’t even scratched the surface of being a driver. As I get on the road with street lights, there’s 6 or so cars driving behind me. I’m looking in the left side mirror, saying “Oh my gosh, oh my gosh”, with my heart beating. Then, there comes this truck who looked like he was trying to get me to go faster. I’m mumbling to myself “Pass me because I’m not going faster.” He does pass me. After I did a U-turn and started to drive back to my house, this van was close to me like the truck from before. It looked like they wanted to pass me and they could have because there were no other cars coming from the other side. They were still following me and I was getting nervous, so, I pulled to the right and let them pass. I couldn’t deal with that. I quickly got to my house before I would have had a nervous breakdown. How do you people do it everyday?",3
8vm3al,park," Why cant I leave the house?. Something, that I'm guessing is anxiety, drives me to the point where I stay home and play video games everyday. I've been wanting to go to the gym, park but I cant pinpoint this feeling of being a little afraid to go. I'm not sure why that is because I do enjoy going out, maybe I've grown use to the habit of staying home? Not sure why I have to try so hard to convince myself to leave the house. ",3

I share a house and a garden with a bunch of (friendly) neighbours and this time around everybody has to water the garden almost daily for about 3 weeks or so. I was just halfway through doing it but then I noticed that my neighbours are sitting in their balcony looking at the garden, which gave me a horrible feeling in my stomach - SA kicks in. I was afraid that they are gonna judge the way I water it and think I'm stupid or whatever, so I quit. This was about 10 min ago and I'm currently sitting in my room writing this and wondering what the hell to do. I skipped the last day because I was exhausted, which means that I **HAVE TO** do it today. Otherwise my neighbours will be pissed because the plants are dry. I'm so afraid of going back out there. I guess I'll just sit here and hope that they are gone within minutes. Fuck my life",3

But I know you do. You guys always make me feel better and I'm super grateful for that. So basically I am at this one-month summer camp (yes, one month of hell) to learn a language. And I can't get out and go away. I signed up because 6 months ago my SA wasn't that bad so I thought why not. Here I am, instead of enjoying this camp, I am dealing with cripping anxiety and depression. It's been only a week and everyone has made their group friends and let me say this: I met a few cool people and became their friend in the first days. Now they made new friends and gave up on me. Fuck this is hard. I feel so alone. Everyone has a group of friends and I'm stuck alone. I am around people 24/7 since I live in a campus. I can't get out. I am too scared to go outside. And when we go on trips, I have panic attacks because I hate being alone. I feel like I'm dying. I really want to disappear. My mind can't bear this anxiety. I am supeeer scared to talk to people :( Anyway sorry for the rant. It's just I can't live with these thoughts anymore so I had to share them. Love you all.",3
8zb3j3,"walk, outside","My 8th grade History teacher ignoring me 7-8 years ago has traumatized me. Advice?. This is going to be a little long, but please read. I am suffering. To give you guys a little background, I'm a 20 year old male. I suffer with social anxiety disorder and I pretty much had it my whole life. However this incident has made my anxiety worse, and I've never really recovered since. When I was young, I used to always be a teacher's pet. Teachers used to love me, and I was always their favorite student. I used to always get special acknowledgment from teachers because of this. In 8th grade (2010-2011 school year) I had a history teacher. At the beginning of the school year he would acknowledge me and give me attention. However, one day after lunch I was walking to his classroom to get to his class. I was down the hall and he was at the door. I guess I was walking a little slow and he yelled, ""Devin hurry up!"". (Looking back on it he didn't even say it in an angry way and I'm mad at myself for letting that get to me.) Ever since that incident I felt like he was mad at me and he didn't like me. Because of this I was always desperate for his approval again. However, I never got it! He never acknowledged me or called on me in class ever! He would acknowledge all of his students except for me. I would stare him down in the hallway or in his classroom hoping he would say something to me, but he never did. I didn't like how every one else got attention from him except for me. I even raised my hand once in his class to answer a question, and he looked at me and didn't call on me! All I wanted was his approval. I have never been treated like this by a teacher before, so it was hard for me to take. I was so used to being a teacher's favorite student. He pretty much ignored me the entire school year. Because of this incident, I'm now desperate for approval from everyone! When I go shopping I get upset when an employee chooses to acknowledge the person I'm with and not me. When people choose to acknowledge someone else over me I get jealous! I struggle making eye contact with people! I'm very sensitive to how people look at me and what people think about me! It's hard for me to relax in public! It's like I want approval from everyone! If I don't get it I get upset and feel like there's something wrong with me. Before the incident with my History teacher, I never had these issues! I'm so upset because I feel like if it wasn't for that situation, my anxiety wouldn't be so bad now and I wouldn't have all these issues. Ever since this incident, my anxiety has been horrible! My anxiety was never this bad prior to this incident. I just feel like I will never be the same person I was before 8th grade. I still had anxiety, but I was able to enjoy life more and interacting with people didn't make me so anxious. Now my anxiety is debilitating. Every time I go outside I instantly get nervous. When people look at me or when cars drive by me I get uncomfortable. I just feel like I will never get better and I'm going to spend the rest of my life being a people pleaser with crippling anxiety. I'm mad at myself that I let a petty incident like this ruin my life! I'm sorry for this rant. I just feel like I will never be able to enjoy life to the fullest again. Any advice for me would be appreciated.",3
90sklv,"outside, walk","I'm suffering with debilitating social anxiety. I feel like I'm going to spend the rest of my life living in fear.. Hello, This is going to be a little long, but please take the time to read this. I don’t know what to do. I’m not trying to gain sympathy or pity, I just need to pour my heart out. I’m 20. I’m a boy. I have social anxiety. It’s something I struggled with my whole life. In school I was always quiet because I was very shy. Students used to always ask me “Why are you so quiet?” Teachers would call my parents and tell them “Your son is very quiet.” My parents would get mad at me because of it. When we would visit family, I was always quiet and in my shell. They would ask me, “Why are you so quiet? You can open up.” I was always shy and uncomfortable around family I didn’t see very often. My father always scolded me after we visited his family for being so quiet and acting uncomfortable around them. I spent a lot of time in the house. My father never liked that. He always wanted me to go outside and play with the other kids in the neighborhood, but I never wanted to out of fear. He would always give me a hard time for always being alone and not having friends. He would say, “You’re always alone, you have no friends.” I know I don’t have any friends and I’m always alone. It was very hurtful to listen to him and hear that, but he’s right. The truth hurts. He still says it to this day. I would talk to people in school, but I would never hang out with them outside of school. I couldn’t take that next step. And people never wanted to hang out with me anyway. They would never ask me if I wanted to hang out with them. They never asked for my phone number. I could never open up to people. I was always awkward and uncomfortable with other students in school. They definitely picked up on that. I went to the same school district since third grade, and I don’t have a single friend from there. My anxiety hit rock bottom out of nowhere during my freshman year of high school. It could be attributed to the fact I was going through puberty and my hormones were raging or it just progressively got worse. I started developing so many issues that were not a problem prior. I started having a hard time making eye contact with people. Being sensitive to how people look at me. If I get dirty looks from someone or a weird look, I feel like something is wrong with me and I’m devastated. When I’m out for a walk and someone is approaching me I either put my face down and look at the ground to avoid eye contact or I try to make the effort to make eye contact with the passerby, but they just look at me funny and I feel awkward. Going out for car rides and feeling like people in other cars are looking at me and judging me. Going out for walks with other people around. People noticing that I’m nervous or uncomfortable and judging me for it. Walking into a room full of people with all eyes on me. Always feeling like people are staring at me and judging me. Just so many issues that became so severe. I always had anxiety, but during my freshman year of high school my anxiety got much worse. Prior to this, my anxiety wasn’t that bad. I was more care-free. It was easier for me to interact with people. I was able to enjoy life more. The issues I started developing weren’t much of an issue in the past. I became so upset that my anxiety gotten worse. I let my mind convince myself that I’m never going to get better. I’m doomed to have social anxiety for the rest of my life. I’m never going to be able to go back to how I was before my freshman year of high school. Going out period around other people became too anxiety inducing for me, so I became a shut-in. I went through the rest of high school with debilitating anxiety. During sophomore year, I started eating lunch in the counseling office because eating in the cafeteria with all the other students became too overwhelming for me. I always walked with a book in my hand for a comfort. I was and still am very self-conscious of the way I walk. People say I walk very stiff or like a robot. Going to school everyday made me extremely nervous. Sitting in the classroom amongst other students and feeling like everyone is staring at me. Walking the hallways. Giving presentations. High school was hell. However I made it through and I graduated. I started college and I didn’t have the college experience. I struggled with anxiety. I just stayed in my dorm all day and did nothing. I didn’t make any friends, join any clubs/organizations, party, etc. I was too afraid to open up. I was too afraid to step outside of my comfort zone and make friends and just have fun. People would try to be my friend, but I was never comfortable. Everyone around me was having the time of their lives, making friends, etc. It was depressing because I wasn’t having any of that. I don’t even want to go back to school next year. I have no life. I just sit in the house all day everyday. I don’t work because I’m too afraid to get a job. How am I going to get through the interview? What if my coworkers won’t like me? What if my manager won’t like me? What if customers or my coworkers think I’m weird because I’m socially awkward? I try to get out of the house, but being out just makes me nervous. I want to have friends and I want to have a life. I feel like I have so much to offer, I just need to get past this awful fear. I go on social media and look at people I went to school with. They are having the time of their lives while I sit on my behind and do nothing. It’s upsetting. I have no personality. I feel like a robot. Everytime I interact with people in public I’m very stiff and robotic. People tell me I’m extremely nice, but honestly I feel like I have no personality. I can’t open up to people. I’m never comfortable and I’m always on edge. I’m living in fear. I just feel like I’m doomed to have social anxiety for the rest of my life. It has gotten so severe to the point where I don’t think I can ever recover. Sorry for the long post, but I needed to pour my feelings out. I’m sick of people telling me I’m just a lazy bum. People don’t know that I’m suffering with debilitating anxiety that’s affecting my life. Any advice will be appreciated.",3
90x4kx,"running, outside"," Just a rant. [I’m not sure if this is where I can post this; I just need to get some stuff off my chest.] So I wish I didn’t give a frack. I wish that I could do whatever I wanted without feeling that crushing wave of social anxiety wash over me, that I could fracking stand in line at the supermarket without having an inner freak out that people are judging me on the type of drink that I got or that I look weird because I was too lazy to pick shoes that matched my cloths. I’m sick and tired of it, literally, this anxiety is physically and mentally exhausting. I wish it wasn’t a struggle to just get up in the morning, that just a simple fracking hello leaves me with hours of unease and regret that I did it wrong. Yeah, yeah, call me crazy, call me irrational, but frick, it’s real and I’ve dealt with it almost every day since I can remember. People tell me that I shouldn’t just say “I wish this” and “I wish that” and that I should just get over it or do something about it. One, frack you guys who say “just get over it”, you’ve probably never dealt with anxiety, it’s like you are carrying the weight of everyone’s judgements and eyes on you with every possibility of any and every event running through your head all the time. It’s traumatic and we live with it everyday and in the end some of us can’t take it any longer, we can’t stand the pressure of living under the umbrella of our own minds. Two, you think I’m not dealing with it? I’ve done therapy, I’ve had over half a dozen different therapists and psychologists, I’ve done the meds and meditation and I still spent over half my junior year of high school locked in my bedroom crying and trying not to end it while my mother thought I just had mono and was “tired”. I am trying, I force myself outside and to interact but it’s terrifying and people just don’t seem to get that. When you’ve lived your whole life with these voices in your head telling you that you’re useless, you’re worthless, that no one likes you or that you’ll mess everything up, it’s hard to just shut it out. They echo all the time; you want to go out for ice cream, they’ll tell you people will think your ice cream choice is weird or you’ll drop the cone all over you or on someone else. Rinse wash and repeat with any and every social situation. Yeah I’m getting better, I’m moving forward. I haven’t ended it, but frack man, it just takes one bad look, one simple “freak” or “weirdo” uttered under someone’s breath that sends me spiraling right back down to that dark place. So yeah, I wish I could just not give a frack about what people think or say but I can’t. I’m still a work in progress and at the moment that’s all I have to give. ",3
9726ot,outside,"Please Read. Hello r/socialanxiety, I am reaching out to you to maybe get some tips about how to get out of this deep hole of social anxiety, depression, frustration and self-hatred I've been in for the last few years, because the last weeks I've been getting progressively more hopeless and even suicidal. I am currently 18 years old and hate just about everything about me. I had to drop out of school at age 15 because of my social anxiety and daily panic attacks. I stopped going outside completly. I got rid of all my friends, I haven't seen a friend in about 2-3 years now. I have been sent to involuntarily inpatient a few times, ran away from there a few times. Eventually the relationship with my mum got really bad and she ""kicked me out"" into my own small apartment. She practically disowned me, she doesn't believe in mental illness and thinks I'm just being lazy. She just leaves groceries and water in front of my door once a week so I don't starve, because I absolutly would prefer that to going outside. I haven't left my apartment in months now. When I even think about going outside, I get panic attacks and can't breathe. I think a lot of my self-hatred comes from my obesity. I don't think I can even change anymore. My apartment is a mess, because I barely have the energy to get out of bed. I sleep all day or play games on the computer. I need medical attention, because I have an infection too, which could kill me any day, but I just can't see anyone without passing out from anxiety. I currently think about killing myself and self-harm daily. I truly hate myself and am so hopeless. Someone got tips? :(",3
98vdcg,outside,"My (17F) anxiety is ruining me. I’ve posted here once before so I’ll reiterate some of the things I’ve mentioned. I was severely bullied through my late elementary school-early middle school years. Developed depression, anxiety, eating issues, and general body dysmorphia. All of these issues I still struggle with today. However, the most severe out of them is my anxiety. I worry over everything; no matter how big or small. The most insignificant thing can send me off in a fit of nerves and panic. I’m plagued with what ifs constantly. I’ve avoided social events because of anxiety. Most of my daily life is fucked up due to anxiety. My anxiety stems from the root of being afraid of messing up. As a kid, I taught myself to be a perfectionist; if I did everything perfectly I wouldn’t get in trouble. If I did everything right and was perfect inside and out, then my parents and friends and family wouldn’t have to worry about me. This has had a disastrous effect. I can’t go outside due to being so nervous of fucking up, doing something stupid, looking dumb, etc. I’ll get this knot in my stomach just thinking about going out with friends. I can’t talk to new/ somewhat familiar people because I get nervous that I’m not talking right or looking stupid or saying the wrong thing or just being overall disinteresting. Anything outside of my daily routine of work/school/home fucks me up. This also relates to new experiences. I’m scared of dating. I’m scared of sex. Whenever I think about these things I get this extreme burning sensation, a heavy fit of nerves, and I have to calm myself down because it gets so intense. I hate going on vacations because I get the what if’s and at the end of the day I just count down to the day I can be back in the safety of my own home. It’s killing me. I hate myself at the fact I can’t do regular things. I don’t have fun. My life is so mundane and basic that it frustrates me, but the anxiety and fear of the outside is what keeps me isolated. I can’t go places. I can’t talk to people. I can’t make new friends. I can’t live my life. I can’t take it anymore. It’s not even the fact that I won’t do it, I physically cannot do it. And it’s not like I can just shove myself out there. I’ve done that before and it’s just made everything worse. I’ve tried going out with a close friend and I hated it so much I just wanted to go home. I thought about trying to go out with a friend and his friends but I feel like I’ll just fuck up and make a mockery of myself. I don’t know what to do.",3
9aoztw,beach,"Is this early social anxiety?. 16M, suffer from GAD (Generalised Anxiety Disorder) since a very young age, this was seen by my many phobias. Im introverted, shy, quiet, INTP (according to the MBTI). In the last few months I have been noticing changes in my behaviour around other people. Ive started to avoid social interactions, I still have friends, a small group of people in my school and in my local band, I talk to them with no problems. I avoid going to the supermarket and other places because I fear I can find someone that I know and I have to talk to them and greet them, this makes me somewhat uncomfortable. I get a little bit nervous when making phone calls. In a conversation I start shaking amd sweating when Im talking about something that I know a lot of. I avoid being around many people like going to the beach, cafes, bars, restaurants and others. When in those places I am always looking at other people because I think they are staring at me and laughing at me for whatever reason. I hate being in the spotlight, this has made me avoid getting into a romantitc relashionship (my family would be all over me asking me uncomfortable questions), has made me avoid social interactions with other people because I fear I will be judged by them for whatever reason. *Note*: I dont have much anxiety in these situations, they just make me uncomfortable, the worst was me shaking my hands a bit and sweating, a increased heart beat but nothing over the top. Are these the early signs of social anxiety?",3

I'm 19, I'm supposed to be a normal guy who is able to enjoy social life, it's never the case for me, I'm not sure where it all went wrong and I find it hard to not blame my parents and the way they raised me, especially that the last therapist I went to is so shitty he encouraged me to blame my parents and friends for my mental problems. Anyways, I have insane social anxiety, I mean unbelievably insane and it doesn't seem to be fixing itself anytime soon, this was the case since I became a teenager, I'm talking at least 5 years of being an insecure guy. When outside I assume everyone is looking at me all the time and judging me on EVERY step I make, and if you were looking at me I sure look like it, it affects my outside image even if I do my best to pretend to be confident. Also my literal self image becomes so weird in my mind and too focused on my insecurities that I feel like I'm a walking goblin when outside. When I look at myself in the mirror afterwards I think it's not as bad as I thought, and this happened countless times it's insane, now it's everytime I go to the university. On top of all this I find it so hard to make friends, and this only happened when I started uni, I'm obviously an introvert but on top of that I always isolate myself, I don't like going to someone and starting a conversation because I always assume they would think like me and hate someone else doing that to them, that maybe I would bother them. Not to mention girls that I find so hard to start and maintain a conversation with, and when one does I pretend I don't care (while getting an anxiety attack), yet I get attached so easily for the stupidest things, getting rejected twice certainly didn't help, but I only blame myself because I handle situations like those so badly.

The only other family that visits is my dad who comes for 1 hour every month. No other family. No friends at all. All because of how significant my anxiety is. I can't handle going outside. I've searched for help for so long. I've sought help from others online, from self help videos and books to personally researching mental illnesses and finding strategies to combat it, but nothing has helped. It continues to grow worse and worse. I've never been to a doctor, so I've never been diagnosed, but I suspect I probably have other kinds of mental illnesses as well as my anxiety, and I'm also having pretty bad health issues that are growing worse and worse. I'm significantly underweight as a male at only 117lbs and 6 ft tall. I have some kind of skin inflammation issue that has been getting worse and spreading all over my body that started in my late teens. Sleeping issues. Joint pain issues. Memory issues. Issues focusing. Issues learning and enjoying things. Anger issues. Incapability of maintaining online friendships. Social issues. The list goes on and on. I'm just really sick. Both mentally and physically. Really, what I want to do is see a therapist. An online one. I've tried everything I can on my own, but maybe talking with a therapist online could help me with my anxiety at least to a point where I can get myself outside to go to a doctor and a therapist in person. The problem is I don't have any money, and since I don't have financial support for something like online therapy, I need help figuring out how I could make money to pay for therapy. I'm basically just so stuck with this. I have literally no skills and don't even know where to begin. I've tried applying for various transcription jobs but I keep getting declined. I've tried looking up online jobs for someone with no qualifications like me and I couldn't find anything at all. I have no useful skills at all. I've wasted my entire life playing video games, and I'm not really even good at them. What I really need right now is some help, developing some kind of skill that I could use to make money. But the thought is so overwhelming to me, because I've tried for my entire life to learn various hobbies, but I really have issues with little to no interest in things, issues focusing, issues learning and memorizing and improving at things have just made it so difficult. I don't know if there's out there who is willing to teach me or help me find some kind of way that I can work online to make some money, but if there is please message me because I could really use some help right now and I don't really have anyone else in life to turn to.",3
ajqysd,"outside, park, walk","Giving up driving. There are a couple of things that trigger my anxiety. People rarely get mad at me but when it happens (even when unjustified) it saddens me and entirely ruins my day. Also, i'm living in my parent's home for 20 years and although i know very few neighbors i feel stalked outside, and it's like everyone knows who i am (the building complex is in a dead-end street and all the windows make me anxious). I took my license 3 months ago and i usually drive as safely as i can. My problem comes from some drivers. The other day i was honked at while stopping at the stop sign. Today i was leaving school's parking lot when i gave way to 2 other students - one looked at me in complete disgust while passing by, the other laughed at me (i even considered if i made some mistake). An hour later i parked in my street and went home. I occasionally heard some honks outside and it made me realize i was missing something. I found someone pulling my windshield wipers up. So i parked a bit more inclined to the road side than to the sidewalk (these are small streets and people usually park in the sidewalk) and other car couldn't pass to the end of the street. I could barely handle the looks while closing the wipers and parking again. This is probably the stupidest reason to stop driving but i can't picture myself inside that car ever again. I've made some other minor mistakes but my impression of being stalked has risen even more. Most people in my country are not rude but the looks i get while walking outside are somewhat the opposite to the anger i feel from some drivers. The truth is that i can't deal with mistakes that require to be solved socially and i found it through a terribly expensive experience.",3

auo6n8,"outside, running"," Medication might be the answer. I recently got on a medication that helps with depression and anxiety, and let me tell you, it has made a huge difference. Of course it didn't completely cure me but it made being around people bearable. Before I got on medication I would wake up with dread knowing I have to go outside and interact with people. Once I got work/school I could feel a knot building up in my throat, my body would get tense, my chest would feel tight, and my breathing became short. I felt like everyone's eyes were on me. The paranoia would creep in, and I literally felt like running. I was isolating myself and never wanted to leave my house which caused me to fall into a bad depression. Now that I'm on medication those symptoms have gone away. I am a shy person, so I still get little nervous when talking to new people. I feel like I can think more clearly when I'm around people and I feel a lot more relaxed. I've come to terms that I'm not gonna be that social butterfly that everyone likes and I'm working on just being myself. There's still some issues I want to work out with a therapist such as my low self-esteem and low-confidence. I feel like I sound like a commercial, but please consider medication if your social anxiety is affecting your life. Also seek help from a therapist. I know it's scary, I've been there, social anxiety kept me from seeing a doctor. But I got tired of being scared of people. ",3

b2gpp1,outside,"Social Anxiety: Road to Recovery. Social anxiety is an awful mental health disorder. Having suffered from it since I was 15, I understand how debilitating it can be to just go outside and how the fear before just doing the simplest of tasks can make you feel. I am making this post because, although I know this subreddit tends to be mainly memes and jokes, and I love it for that, we do all share one common thing - we all suffer/do suffer from social anxiety. And for many, this post will be useless, but when I first subscribed to this subreddit, I’d never done anything significant to truly address and deal with my mental health. I had a feeling of hopelessness that I no longer have, and if I could go back in time and give these words to myself, I would. If this post can help just one person, then I’ll be happy! But right, in the last year, I met a girl. I struggle with going to University, but I need a future. She made me NEED to get better, and I wish I had the self control to make MYSELF force myself to take steps in getting better. I know for a fact there is someone reading this who hasn’t taken these steps to try and improve their social anxiety, because the social anxiety itself prevents people from doing so. Getting help involves speaking to say, a doctor, or a therapist, and this can be a massive, scary deal. So, with having social anxiety, it can be tremendously difficult to take the first steps to recovery. This is unique, in that suffering from a mental disorder such as OCD or depression doesn’t necessarily restrict you seeking help in the sense of being unable to get yourself, on your own, to see a doctor or a therapist. However, you have to want to get better. You have to know that you deserve better, that social anxiety is NOT normal, is NOT something anyone should suffer with, and that it IS a strongly researched mental health disorder which is legitimate and known by every health professional. You need to enforce this desire, and you have to make a doctors appointment. This will create a dialogue with your GP. You have to see what support is there for you. Your GP speaks to hundreds of people every week, with a whole host of different issues, both physical and mental. Mental health is a massive public health issue and is finally being treated as such. SEE. YOUR. DOCTOR! Doing this was the best thing I ever did, even though I was terrified when I had my first appointment. I am not ashamed to admit that I had some alcohol before going, thought about cancelling in the week leading up to the appointment and was just downright terrified of going. But I did, I said that I had anxiety, in social situations, and guess what - he understood. Doctors. Don’t. Judge. I was put on a small dose of medication - was a bit weird for the first few days, as it made me lose my appetite and feel a bit weird, but it settled. You don’t notice the affects of anxiety medication too much, it takes about 6 weeks for it to have any affect. It’s likely you’ll also have your dose increased after your body settles on it. It can feel like a long process, you just want to stop having these feelings of anxiety, of dread, of fear going somewhere and having the physical symptoms of your anxiety presenting themselves and embarrassing you. But it’s just the first step to getting better - medication CAN work. Some say it doesn’t work for them, but it definitely makes some difference for some, and I am living proof of that. Next - therapy. I wouldn’t have been able to do a single therapy session if it weren’t for medication. Some will be able to, and if you are, great. Secondly, money. I live in the UK, and here the NHS offer therapy for free if the patient needs it, so I’m lucky in that sense, although the waiting list was 3 months. I am aware that in many countries, therapy isn’t cheap. However, even where money is tight, please realise that your mental state is so important, and is ABSOLUTELY worth spending money on in looking to improve it. Social anxiety is not normal, and is not something you should have to be subject to every day. You deserve to get professional help. For those who literally cannot afford therapy, I sincerely apologise and ask you to see if there is anything you can do to get the help you need. Therapy is scary, at first. But it’s also the best thing I’ve forced myself to do. You become familiar and comfortable with a therapist. They understand social anxiety, they put you at ease and remind you that this is their JOB, and that they deal with patients with social anxiety EVERY SINGLE DAY. These are things you can do, that WILL make an improvement to your social anxiety. It will make your quality of life better, and it is absolutely worth doing. You only get one life on this earth, don’t live yours in the shackles of social anxiety because you deserve better. Support is out there!",3

On top of that I am hideous, have a shriveled annoying voice and stutter, I'm unintelligent and have no motivation in life. I only hang out with my boyfriend and I'm so jealous of how easy it is for him to make friends. His friends think I'm ugly and annoying. It's not just that I'm ugly, I look hideously deformed, have thick body hair that looks horrible when shaved, thick frizzy hair, and a horrible out of shape body. I am embarrassed to go outside no matter how much I dress myself up and wear makeup and try to kid myself. I'm not a confident person unless I get $20,000 for full plastic surgery and laser hair removal and somehow change my voice. I haven't had a friend in 10 years. I try so hard but it's not happening.

c1ot8a,"park, run","Rejection and how to overcome it?. I feel like this is the right place to share this, and probably sounds all too familiar to most of you, at least some of it may. I'll start by listing the things my social anxiety has stopped me from doing, from most severe (what I really wish I could do) to not so severe (it's annoying but I don't dwell on it): 1. Messaging people first 2. Exercising 3. Wearing short clothing in public 4. Meeting potential partners 5. Needing alcohol to speak to people I don't know too well 6. Going out at night The most horrifying thing that I deal with is never messaging friends first, since I am always under the impression that I'm bothering them, and that they don't want to speak to me. I'm always ""alert"" for subtle cues that they make in order to confirm my suspicions. A friend of mine never responds anyway so I've stopped trying, even though I would love to keep up the friendship. My old friends from high school never messaged me first so I convinced myself that I upset them, so we eventually lost touch. In my defence, any time I do message first, they rarely respond and if I try to make plans, they never accept. I found out recently that they made plans without me which definitely hurt. I suppose I'm looking for a fresh perspective on the situation. I don't exercise. At all. My local park is always full of people so I don't go there, and the gym is always full and leads into my next issue (short clothing). I don't like the way I run - I imagine myself to be like Phoebe from Friends. I can't wear short clothing in public. Shorts, T-Shirts what have you. I feel the need to cover every part of me that I can. Doesn't matter if it's 100° out, I'll still be wearing a sweatshirt and jeans. I'm 21 and have been single my entire life because I'm absolutely terrified of rejection from others. I've never asked a girl out, or even spoken to one in more than a platonic manner. The last two aren't such an issue, though as I say, they're annoying. The thing is, I've got a degree in Psychology, and know that the best way to do it is through exposure, but even the thought of it sends my heart racing. In addition, I've overcome Obsessive Compulsive Disorder in the past but cannot seem to fix my current issues. Can anyone offer any advice, or even just a comment/perspective?

cgnupn,"basketball, soccer, walk","This gave me anxiety and now is hard to hangout with my friends.. Hi, I’m 13 male and i like to play street basketball with friends, play soccer and play basketball on my school team. So anyways i have something that is still really bothering me that happened 2 days ago. I was hanging out with my friend after school and his name is Dylan. We were wanting to get a street basketball game going so we called a bunch of guys and planned on playing in a hour. We had 8 guys interested. My brother was also interested and wanted to play so we said he could play. Then my mom said little later. I have a doctor appointment booked for you in 30 minutes and you have to go before you can play with your friends. She suggested all 4 of us (me, my bro, dylan) drive together to my doctor appointment and then she would drive us to the game. I said ok and quickly ran upstairs to my bedroom and put on my basketball jersey with shorts on. Then i said i’m ready to go. So we all drove to the doctors. Once we were there we didn’t have to wait long because it was booked already and the nurse comes to the waiting room and calls my name. I get up and saw my bro and dylan still sitting. I told them they could come too if they want. My mom then said are you sure because your your going to get a physical exam done. I didn’t know what that was and thought it meant was going to be showing how physical fast and strong i am. So they know im not weak for my age. So i told them yeah i don’t mind them coming in. So we got in the doctors room and we are waiting for 5 minutes and the doctor walks in. He says hi to me and my mom and then notices my friend and brother sitting in the room too. He then said are you sure you want your brother or friend in here when we do your physical exam? I said i don’t mind. Still not know what that really means. The doctor then said ok can you sit on the bed and take off your jersey? so checked my heartbeat and measured my waist. Then said ok can you remove your shorts. I was wondering why he was telling me to do this and was little embarrassed taking my shorts off in front of my brother and friend because both of them have never saw my in my underwear before or naked. Besides when i was 5 years old having a bath with my brother was the last time. So i take off my shorts and he told me to lay on the bed. So i did and pushing my tummy and using this triangle thing on my knee that makes my knee jump. He then told me he needs to check my bowels so told me to lay on my side facing away from everyone. He then lowers my underwear and my butt is now showing to everyone and i was so embarrassed! i could hear my bro and dylan giggling a bit. So then the doctor uncomfortably puts his finger in me and kinda hurt and then it was done and got me to stand up. I felt really embarrassed already and noticed my friend holding his phone and smiling. He had his phone down so i don’t know if he took a video or picture of me. Then the doctor said Can you please remove your underwear?! I was so nervous and felt anxiety coming in and looked at my bro and dylan who looked really excited. So i took off my underwear and covered myself and the doctor said put your hands on your sides. I could hear my bro and friend giggling but didn’t want to look at them. The doctor then checked everything including my frontal area for 5 minutes and also told me to turn around. Once everything was done and we left the doctors i felt so embarrassed! I didn’t want to talk to anyone. It was nobody’s fault but mine because my mom and the doctor both warned me and i didn’t know what a physical exam is. I can’t blame them. So my mom dropped us off at the basketball game but i really didn’t want to play cause i was having social anxiety and i sat off to the side. My bro and friend i noticed were talking to some guys and looked at me. I don’t know if they took a picture of me or video something but i felt embarrassed. What you think i could do to get over this social anxiety i’m still feeling? It’s been 2 days now. and what you think about all of this?",3
ci77f3,outside,Going to doctor about anxiety. Hello I will be 18 years old in 10 days and probably since last summer I have been feeling really anxious about everything I do like going outside with friends or going by bus. It has got worse and worse each time I have to go somewhere and I tried even telling it to my best friend. That helped for a little bit of time but it's the same now. So I wanted to go talk about it to my doctor when I am 18 so finally my question is : Can she tell my parents about my visit because I will have the same doctor for one more year. I know that my parents won't understand so I don't want them to know yet. I searched for answer a little bit but I wanted to make sure. Or is it better to just try to call some therapist and ask them? Sorry for my English it's not my first language.,3

And visiting a psychologist is insanely expensive and I only did it 7 times before I realized it was too unproductive for the money that i had to spend, and visiting a psychiatric clinic was a bunch of roundabout of getting diagnoses, then getting re-diagnosed to find out I didn't have said diagnosis and then eventually getting pills that made me feel like shite and bam, I'm back to square one.

Every time I stuttered or wasn’t ready for a question or didn’t have a witty response to a comment or told a joke that fell flat. I just sit and reflect, reliving those moments over and over, imagining what my professional character would do differently to handle that situation better. And make new scripts and lines for those responses. When I’m not at work I am almost like a different person, I can’t talk to any stranger. Gyms terrify me. Throwing a frisbee in front of someone I don’t know is horrifying. I can’t ride a bike in public without feeling like everyone’s staring at me. I dare not inconvenience anyone. I seldom do anything alone so I can blend in better, but the thing is, I love doing things with people and meeting them, but I just can’t meet them as me until like 3 years down the line before I take done the persona. Sorry, I rambled a lot. I just really related hah. I love hanging out and meeting people I just need this facade to give me the confidence to do it. My goal is to get rid of this bull honky persona because it is exhausting sometimes. It feels like I’m lying to myself but I can’t tell if it’s the socially anxious me lying about being scared or if the he out going me lying about being out going. I dunno, it’s all kinda stupid. I feel you pal.",3
e3en2w8,"walk, outside", I don’t feel like I walk fast but I do feel like I’m not able to walk properly and whenever I’m around people and I’m walking somewhere I get super anxious and constantly feel terrified I’m being watched and that everyone’s judging me on how I’m walking and how I look that’s why I hate going outside ,3
e3enlx0,"outside, walk", I do crave too be social too but every time it always fucks me over as I can’t really go outside with out getting intense felling of fear like I can’t walk in public cars driving past me terrify and so does getting the bus or anywhere I go I just have terrible anxiety ,3
e6hinb,"outside, walk","I can't go outside anymore. Hearing cars and people talking outside. Hearing my neighbors coming in and out of their apartments. It always gives me anxiety. I have avoidant personality disorder, so as it says I avoid every possible contact with other human beings. I currently don't have clean clothes because I'm scared of going to the laundromat. I was about to go, I was happy about getting clean clothes. But when the time I had to get out came I froze. Having to walk 3 miserable minutes to get there. Having to face people looking at me, noticing I exist and possibly judging me. It is just too much for me. I also don't have anything to eat. But I'm scared to go to my local grocery store because I've been going there a lot recently. What if the cashier judges me for buying a lot of food.. I'll just have to wait until Sunday when there's no one outside to go to the laundromat and go to an other grocery store.. I'm so tired. My social anxiety is so bad it is preventing me from living a normal life. I'm constantly worrying for BS. Can someone tell me it gets better..",3
ea1tf23,"outside, walk","I can't bring myself to go outside. Maybe if I'm going out for a walk in the rain at 3am, okay, but even that makes me anxious and paranoid asf. The exact opposite end of that spectrum is being in a group environment like group therapy or talking face to face with some professional about any kind of health issue. Even with headphones. It's just not the feeling of possibly having to talk to someone, but just being seen by someone, even if they don't know me or want to talk to me. Just being looked at. I just can't do it. I don't want a gofundme. I already feel like a financial burden. That's all I am. I want to feel accomplished and like I was able to pay for something myself. I don't want donations or handouts from others. I don't really deserve them in the first place, nor do I think that if I did that people would actually be able to donate enough to pay for online therapy for any reasonable amount of time.",3
echpva0,park,"I'm 21 and i still don't feel comfortable at a park on my own. I feel both too old to be there, but also young enough to be a target of an attack. So many people go out at night? That sounds risky and terrifying. But im glad so many people seem to enjoy it :)",3
egdem29,"running, walk, beach, run","To me, in some ways it lessens, in others it's more like ups and downs. Some places if I stop going, I'll be anxious again as if it's the first time, other things like running, everytime I go out of my apartment and walk the path until the beach, I feel anxious and uncomfortable (3 or 4/10) it's mild anxiety but still bothersome. After idk how long, I still don't feel comfy about it. Funny is that after I run, I don't feel that uncomfortable at all.",3
fznuwdu,walk," Yup. I was getting over a serious bout of agoraphobia after some traumatic shit happened to me in my final year of uni, and just as I was making real progress and leaving the house two or three times a week this happened. Today was my monthly walk to the pharmacy to pick up meds and I felt absolutely sick with nerves over a half hour walk. It’s horrible seeing my progress decline like this. ",3
g3v4vc7,"outside, walk","All of the above. I love outside but even taking a walk around my neighborhood is nervewracking for me. There's always the off chance a man will try to approach me, ask for money or something even though I don't have any. Also just feels like people are staring at me any time I'm in public. Like I feel like I can't even conduct myself around people most of the time. It takes days of mental preparation for me to have interactions with anyone other than my boyfriend. I'm really lucky I have him at least. I'm also unemployed right now, been unemployed this whole year, feeling like a huge failure. I just graduated last year and did one internship, but nothing after that. I constantly feel disappointed in myself but at the same time terrified of going through all the interview processes. Zoom stuff is just as scary if not scarier than real life interviews for me. After dealing with so many phonecalls and appointments I finally got my ADHD medication again yesterday after being unmedicated since around March. It's honestly been the biggest struggle for me jumping through all these hoops with insurance and doctors after my previous doctor had to close his office. Being medicated vs not is the difference between actually being able to focus on tasks longer than 5 minutes vs flitting from one thing to another and ultimately accomplishing nothing at the end of the day.",3
tgtk6y,"outside, walk, parks","I really need help. I've been dealing with what is presumed to be social anxiety for the past 4-5 ish years and I pretty sure it stated because of how I was picked on in elementary school. Over the past 2 years it's gotten really bad, I haven't spoken to anyone outside of my family in months, I haven't left the house in months and I just ultimately can't function properly unless I'm alone in my room. I find it hard to do simple things like taking the dog for a walk. And I always avoid going to stores, restaurants, parks etc to avoid people. Anyways I've never told anyone and I've never been formally diagnosed... But at this point it's pretty obvious. I'm 17 and I would really like to get the help I need, but I have no idea who/how to reach out to people. As I said before I have literally no friends and I don't feel confident enough to tell my family. I'd really like to know some ""first steps"" I could take in order to get help.",3
