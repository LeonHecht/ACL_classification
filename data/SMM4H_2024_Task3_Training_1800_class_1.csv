d3moq94,walk," Do you feel like the texts that you send back and forth are pretty flirtatious? I think that would be a good way to gauge whether or not he has similar feelings towards you. In terms of talking to him in person, you don't necessarily have to give off the perfect impression every time you are with him. If he is a genuine guy, he won't judge you for appearing a little shy or vulnerable. But at any rate, my advice to you is to do whatever it is that calms you down (listen to music, take a short walk, etc.) and just go for it. Whether he responds positively to you or not, you will never know unless you try. Also, don't try and force yourself to act any differently and be true to yourself. This is all pretty cliche, but it really is the truth haha, and the older I get, the more I realize it. But yeah, just be yourself and give it a shot, you won't get a second chance if you don't do it now so go for it! I hope I was able to help a little and good luck!! ",1

Maybe it'll help with my SA :) As for books, the Millenium (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, ...) trilogy is amazing, and my favorite book is the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The movies were good for all of these, but the books are worth the read even if you watched the films. Specially HGttG. ",1
d5bzg04,walk," Something that work for me is to expose myself to my anxiety. Even though I'm starting to become anxious, I keep doing it. The trick is to not go over a threshold. If I'm too anxious, it affect how I act and then everything goes bad (not that bad but my anxiety amplify everything that goes bad and then I keep thinking about it and it just worse). Taking a walk is a great way, you can start in a residential place with less people and then move on to place with more and more. Going to movie theaters, fast-food, restaurants, conventions, also helped me. All situations where I had just a little anxiety but that let me see how people acts and let me understands them a little better. Another thing that you need to do, is stopping to be negative about yourself. You don't seems to be that negative, though you do say ""anyone who bothers to read this"" which seems like it's negative reading your thread (it doesn't bother us, we are there to read theses threads, like any other one), but it's important that you are aware that you should avoid negative though. Often we justify being negative by saying that this way you are aware of your flaw, which is better than not. Sadly often we are wrong, theses negatives though aren't that important and they are amazing to lose any motivation to improve. Instead, you need to find the positive in the situation and if really there's something negative important, don't see it as negative but as something to improve.  at this point i have no assurances and putting my faith in a psychologist only to go thru months and years of no improvement would probably destroy me. It doesn't destroy you right now? Really how trying anything is worst than not trying anything and staying the mess you are right now? Believe me, you can't be worst than you are right now, you can fail, and you may fail often, but that will just bring you back to where you are right now. Anxiety is a bitch though and it will always try to give you the impression you don't improve and are just worst than you ever was by simply trying. You need to stay positive. Therapist know what you live, they know plenty of ways of dealing with it, they are the professional, they know what they are doing. I never saw one because I'm sure I can fix that by myself, I hate depending on someone, but I have no doubt that I would be able to do it much quicker than currently with their help. I already convinced myself to go see one if I no longer see improvement. ",1

But now that school has started, not only can't I run there but theres like the fear of morning hustle  and bustle of parents dropping off kids no matter where I run. Running in the daytime is just the worst so many people.

There's something about a warm car ride through the cold night. Its funny I think with the nose thing I actually get the opposite. My nasal tracked gets super dry to the point it's very painful to even breath. But I'll just carry saline around in my pocket. Also it never really lets up for me either. Its like how I've noticed people in the SA community often say how they play video games all day. Sure they might do that to occupy their time, but it doesn't change the fact that they're extremely socially anxious  and depressed. That might be the thing for them. But personally the only thing I have is music,  and the desperation for winter. The winter means a lot of quite time, sitting outside, or going on long walks because I don't have to be as anxious. There are much less people out  and about when its cold. So just more time to myself... ",1
d8nyn21,"outside, jog, run","You and me, we're at the same place. 23 years, barely any real life experience, sick of studying to work when we can't even find ways to enjoy free time outside of it; we fucking need to do something completely different. I have been contemplating ever since the last semester started of dropping out and then doing something drastic that's totally outside of what I have done before. I grow too apathetic and careless in this state. I should travel or something and get to see life more so I don't feel so detached. I thought moving out would be the start of me forcing myself to having to go out more, but it's the opposite. I have the extra stress of having to take care of myself, but now I can fully isolate and not seek out people every day and I don't have parents or siblings that get guests or even people I get to talk to. Last weekend I spoke to nobody for 2 days straight, and now I'm derealized again. I'm also depressed again and it makes me work slow, and get behind in my studies and I don't even like playing video games anymore because everything bores me to death. I'm sure it's just another episode of us being depressed OP and then perhaps in a week we'll have a couple of good days again. I used to jog once a week in the summer leading up to semester start, but it's getting colder outside and I'm more exhausted and don't get as many things done. But I think we really need something to revitalize us. Also, I envy you for actually having a place with girls. I study in a small town because it's the only place in my country with the special education found there, but there's only like 5 girls there. Normally I don't have a chance at flirting to begin with because I'm so awkward and anxious but now there's not even any girls that stick out that I can daydream about _ It sucks and I'm just tired as shit of living here. Anyway, we're practically venting the both of us, but hang in there and make the best of tomorrow. Let the depression run its course until you're reminded of something positive you can do.

d8p0hv7,walk,"It's true for me. I realized it more and more into my university life, especially as classes became more demanding and I had to rely on other people. 70% of my classes have been team-based, and I mean compulsory team projects/presentations which means that I can't just study my ass off alone in my house anymore. Trying to be part of a team is constantly putting stress on me. Presentations are a nightmare. I struggled during my internship because of my bad social skills, but I managed. I study computer engineering and I thought I could be a genius programmer and code all day every day. But no, no matter what your job is, social skills are a must. I'm not saying this to scare you, but it's what I've learned. Even in the college world, I see many people who pass because they hang out with the best students, they share the best notes, get familiar with professors, etc. And I don't accomplish as much with sheer work and dedication. During this time I have managed through difficult situations, I have somehow improved my social skills, but I still struggle every single day. If I were you, I would start by trying to connect with fellow students. It's not about having friends, it's about securing your ""network"" in case you need to work with others in the future. Try to find some people that you see often and maybe sit next to them in class. You can do some small talk by asking them if they know how X thing is solved or something. I believe that going out of the house is beneficial even if you don't have a purpose. Just go on a walk to relax. There are periods when I get stuck at home for many days in a row and my SA deteriorates significantly. Don't isolate yourself, just try to push yourself little by little. Also, there's no need to ever compare yourself with others. You do what's best for you and let others do their thing.",1

A lot of people on there are having the same problems you are. Change your diet to a healthy diet(no sugars or wheat), stop masturbating along with watching porn, exercise daily(running or working out), take cold showers daily, meditate, and limit your amount of time watching tv or being on your phone/computer. All these things can attribute to feeling extremely better and having more energy. Also try things that will challenge your social anxiety in a positive way.

When it comes to these things, the best next course of action is to organize yourself. Lay out your plan of action. Think about what your next step should be after you have dealt with the obvious emotional baggage that is created following a breakup from such a longterm relationship. Another thing: before you let someone love you, you need to love yourself. It seems to me that you relied on him too much (I hope this does not sound harsh; totally not my intention), and now don't know what to do. Remember that relationships are not a MUST. Don't feel like you need someone, or need to be with someone. Instead, for now try to work on your emotional state and stability. Join a yoga class, start running, anything to let out some of the pent up anxiety and frustration. Painting is a beautiful way (I find) to express your emotions. These are some of my favourite quotes from some of the world's most treasured artists (that get me through my dark days): ""The main thing is to be moved, to love, to hope, to tremble, to live."" -Auguste Rodin ""To be an artist is to believe in life.""-Henry Moore ""For me, painting is a way to forget life. It is a cry in the night, a strangled laugh."" -George Rouault ""Every artist dips his brush in his own soul, and paints his own nature into his pictures.""-Henry Ward Beecher Although I have personally never dealt with a breakup (never been in a relationship either), my friend has recently broken up with her boyfriend of 8 years (also in her 30s). It's terrible because you both believed you had everything set for the rest of your lives, and then this happens. The immediate reaction is to cry and feel like your world is falling apart. And that's fine. Your feelings are valid. But you need to remember (just like your friends said, although how they said it might have sounded rude or dismissive) he is just one guy. You'll have to move on, just like he will. Obviously he is a douchebag. MAJOR douchebag, for having led you on for so long, and now not explaining himself. Don't jump to conclusions. I think you are not to blame. He is immature and not ready to committ (oops, seems like I'm jumping to conclusions just a little bit.) Anyways, once your financial situation is back in order (maybe ask your friends or if you have siblings to help you out..any good friend would.) maybe look into getting a pet. They are amazing companions and will never treat you bad! A low budget pet, like a rat could be an option (they are one of the most loving animals; like a little dog that cleans himself!).

dc1x6dw,"running, run","Hey man! I've been at that point. Didn't have real man tits, but like ~30kg to much (I'm a 1.85cm guy). And I was really uncomfortable with it. Struggled with that for years, it made me unattractive and other things, but I was more afraid of working out in a gym and people seeing how fat i was and how I wouldn't perform the exercises right then of living with it. So I did nothing. Then during my last year of school due to the lack of any social life and stuff I decided I had to do at least something meaningful in my life (playing games, programming and watching minute physics all day didn't satisfy anymore, it didn't serve any purpose). Then I started running, every day in the evening though the fields, where no one could see and bother me. I think I started with 1km, really slow, and I truly hate running. And i was really bad at it. But at least at the end of the Day I had the feeling that I'd done at least one thing that served a purpose on that day. I got better at it, started running longer rounds and faster, I used one of these running tracking apps, they motivate A LOT! Even started to enjoy it sometimes a bit. At the same time I started running I cut back my food intake (in retrospective I ate way too less then I should have). Both these things where just hard on a physical level - I was a) hungry and b) running is hard work. BUT you're not working against your fears in that case, so it's doable! Fast forward some months later, I was still going on a run every day, and I partially hated it. But I got better, I lost weight, and for the first time in my life I ran 5km. Thinking ""wow, I've never archived that in my life before"" was a very good, receiving and rewarding thought. Same for 6,7,8,9 and 10km. Almost a year later, I was down 30kg at my target. Still had all my other anxieties and shit, but my weight wasn't one anymore. Since I started college after that I thought ""why not join a gym, I want to build up muscles"" and from there on I went at least 3 times / day, and I love it! Since my weight wasn't an issue before and I had a good friend of mine with me who showed me everything anxiety wasn't an issue there, the only thing needed was work. And it was sure rewarding, I looked better. Now, 2 years later, I'm comfortable with the way I look - still have most of my other issues, only started working on them recently, but seriously, weight and muscles are the easiest issues to fix (that doesn't make it easy, I know, I've been there!). **I truly believe you can do that too**!

Some people prefer listening to music, taking a walk or a bath, etc. Doing an activity that you enjoy can sometimes take your mind of your worries, but I personally understand that thoughts can get overwhelming no matter what you're doing. Working bit by bit to relax will help you master the ability... in my experience as an ""anxious person,"" I couldn't just ""get relaxed"" immediately. It's taking time to find out what works by trying a few things.

ddumf9z,"park, walk"," Hate to tell you what you already know, but trial and error is the best way. Exposure therapy. Something that I first did when I started to try and improve my SA was to go to my local park and just go for walks. I made it a point to smile and nod to everyone I passed, and eventually gave a verbal ""hi there"" or ""hey."" I won't forget how hard that was at the time, and how far I've come *because* of those days. So bars and clubs don't really vibe with you, they aren't my thing either unless someone invites me, but there are other outlets! If you have a local card shop or board game shop I would bet they have weekly gatherings and play MTG or Monopoly (these kinds of places tend to attract a crowd of people with SA and as I'm sure you can guess they are very welcoming people.) I also spend a lot of time with my sisters, I can honestly call them my best friends! They have helped me tremendously with my SA, I've got a long ways to go, like yourself I've never been in a relationship. I try not to let that get me down though, it's a daily struggle but I try hard to have a positive outlook, and I'm very proud of that. I would say your best bet to developing friendships is to find them within your work. It's tough I know, god do I know, but more often than not if you're kind to people and have a genuine interest in what they say and who they are you will naturally fall into a routine with them, who knows, maybe they will invite you out somewhere!

I'm friendly enough but they aren't really a part of my life so I tend to avoid them. You say you have more pressing issues, are they issues that can be solved by curling up in your room? I'm going to guess not, everyone with SA has issues they need to work on, finding out how to solve them in a way that suits you best is what is hard as hell. For me it began with just walking my local park and saying ""hi"" to everyone I passed. I was alone but not lonely, that's what so tough about having SA and being introverted. I understand your pain, and it can be very embarrassing to isolate yourself when surrounded by a ton of people, as well as very, *very* distracting for yourself. I think a great option would be to possibly look for someone else, or to spend less time at home and more time working on your issues. Self discipline is incredibly helpful with SA. ",1
de1aegy,"running, walk","I hear ya man.. I turn almost 21 this year and have social anxiety pretty badly. I can say it is not as severe as having to drop out of school but it was pretty close to it. A few things I can tell you: 1) Mindfulness. Something I SHOULD practice more of.. but mindfulness is a form of meditation to help bring your mind out of the constant state of thinking (i.e. about if others are judging me) and brings you to a complete focused state. Look up mindfulness audio sessions or something like that on google, there is plenty of tutorials and things to help. 2) ""Don't break the chain"" ..its something the famous comedian Jerry Sienfeld talked about. This is a comedian who has done so many stand up routines that it seemed so unlikely he was able to write that many jokes! How does he do so many one hour specials?! He mentioned it was something he calls ""dont break the chain,"" or in other words he would write a joke every single day, good or not, but do so EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. The reason I say this is because you should find something to work on every single day, no matter what! I myself joined a gym about a year and a half ago.. it was not because I wanted to lose weight (though that was on my mind as well) but because I needed some constant factor in my life that I would put forth effort each day to complete, something I HAD to do, to keep my mind on it.. You should find something to do, even if it's just drawing a small picture or running a mile.. do it EVERY DAY! And if for whatever reason you can't.. just do it the next day! In all of my years in dealing with social anxiety (and a negative family putting me down) I realize that the anxiety stems mostly from overthinking. Is that person looking at me from their car as I walk down the street? Am I worthless because I don't have a job? Is what I'm wearing okay? etc. the list is endless. For me, social anxiety has stopped me from my potential being fully realized. It has stopped me from having a healthy relationship with pretty much any woman. It has stopped me from going out on the few beautiful days I see here.. I still have it, but not as bad. I practice a few things every day and you eventually reach a point of self confidence. You will know when you start to get comfortable with yourself and you start having thoughts like ""who gives a shit what they think! This is what I'M doing for me!"" One last note: I currently live in an area where cannabis is legal for recreational use. I started smoking not for my social anxiety itself but the fact that many other people here seemed to do it. I started smoking to make friends but now I keep smoking because it does make me feel good and content with the world around me. Not saying you should smoke pot but it is something that has helped me very greatly. Hopefully I was of some help, either way the best of luck to you!",1

Once you've done that for a while, try hanging out with your friends. Doesn't have to be much, could even be a movie. The way I've met most of my friends has been through mutual friends. You're kind of forced to meet and talk to each other, and it can grow into something good. And hey, if you get invited to a party, go. Hang out with the people you know, and eventually you'll talk to other people. Basically start small and build your way up. I'm not great at socializing myself, but this has helped.

I enjoyed trails with a lot of turns so I wasn't constantly in sight of people. But once I got used to it (I had to force myself a few times) I went to different trails that had a more straight path for a change of scenery.

I quit everything that I considered negative in my life: My shitty job, shitty friends, shitty habits. I literally did a hard reset on life and it put me back... like way fucking back.

dfiq8ww,walk,"I wouldn's say I've overcome it completely yet but I do feel much better now compared to how I was a year ago where I barely left my house all by myself. I like to think of these things like challenges/experiments. For example, if you're afraid of walking around the streets by yourself, start off by walking around the neighbourhood where you still feel slightly anxious, but a lot safer, and continue doing that until you feel like there's no threat anymore then go for bigger things, if you've got phone anxiety then dial strangers on purpose and act stupid then say you've got the wrong number and hang up. If wanna talk freely to a group of around 6 people for example, try expressing yourself when there's only 2 people for example. You know, baby steps. I also tried to neutralize my anxious thoughts. If an anxious thought would suddenly occur about an upcoming event, I would try to calm myself down and say something like ""Maybe, it won't be as bad as I think, maybe I'll do better this time, it can't be that bad."", ""I've done this before and I know I'll do it again, I certainly won't die!"" Mantras such as ""I am completely independent of the good and bad opinions of the others"" in my opinion also help. ""Haters gonna hate"", ""I can only be myself, and if someone doesn't like me for it, then it's their problem, not mine"". ""I am just as important as anyone else is."", etc.. Sometimes if I fail and end up being awkward or anxious I just try to pick myself up, dust myself off and congratulate myself for at least trying, telling myself that maybe next time I'll do better because I know that as long as I keep trying and moving on, and some day when that last restriction of my life melts away, I will finally reach my goal where I'll be happy, anxiety free and live the life I've always wanted.

Drink more water, and go for jogs/walks more often. If you keep this up it will be substantially beneficial. Man, the only way you can fully get on the path towards progress is to forgive yourself, be self-compassionate. It's alright to make mistakes, as long as we use them as stepping stones. Continue writing, you don't have to be Nabakov or Charles Dickens to start. Let yourself take baby steps instead of expecting full recovery of yourself in an instant. One thing I kind of did with social anxiety and depression was go, ""Fuck it. Why do I care about this? Why do I overthink? The world will eventually end and nothing will matter. None of these people are anything in the grand scheme of things. I am nothing as well. Thus I have nothing to lose, and I'm free to just do whatever I want without this fear. I have the right to. In this short life I'm just going to live the best I can. I deserve that."" No time is really wasted. It's all how you look at things. ",1

dg1aktj,hike,"Only liking 35-40% of the girls probably means you are more picky on appearance than you realize. It also means you already set a value on attractiveness that you think you deserve and feel entitled to. This is bad because you're missing out on meeting the other 65% of the women on tinder. If you haven't matched already, it probably means you are going for women that are out of your league appearance wise based on tinder profile pics. This could either mean you aren't as good looking as you think you are, or you are not putting very flattering pictures of yourself on tinder. I'm going to guess it's the second one. If you don't have an awesome body to show off I would avoid taking mirror pics or selfies at your house. I would avoid selfie pictures entirely unless you have a unique background that says a story about you and is flattering to your face. Go find a hike with an awesome view and have someone snap a picture of you. Or go to a popular/trendy spot in town and get a picture taken. Or take a funny absurd picture in front of a tv that has you interacting with one of the characters. Hope this helps man. With social anxiety you have to unlearn a lot of the effects of having it and be open to being silly in public and work really hard to get rid of the entitlement complex. Because to you, you're trying so hard to put yourself out there, but to anyone else it's just a regular day if that makes sense. That's how I think I developed the nice guys complex at least. It took a lot of effort to put myself out there and because of that I think I deserved more just because I had to really try and over come my SA. I felt like if I did ask someone out that they were assholes if they said no because I put so much effort into it. I failed to see women as people, only as goals. And trying so hard to not reach your goal sucks. This was a really fucked up way of thinking that took a long time to unlearn for me. Most people you meet won't even know you have social anxiety unless you tell them. And if you do they probably haven't a clue what that means other than you hate crowds.",1

di12cc,outside,"I think I have body dysmorphia?. Okay so, I’m 13, I have social anxiety, I haven’t went to school or barley went outside for a year. I’ve always knew that I was insecure. Ever since I was a kid, I had problems with certain body parts that I deemed as “imperfect.” But, it got worse over the years. When I turned 9, I started covering my face with my hair because I felt better if I wasn’t exposing too much of my face When I was 10, I started developing social anxiety and started wearing baggier clothing, I also started looking in the mirror for hours a day. When I turned 11, I started covering my face more than ever before, I’d only wear certain types of clothing that I thought were “less revealing,” my anxiety started to become worse than it’d ever been before and got pulled out of school for it. When I was 12, I started noticing changes in my appearance from hour to hour, or day to day, these changes were usually in my face. Everyday, I’d wake up and think to myself, “okay, am I gonna be pretty or ugly today?” I don’t really know what the real me looks like anymore, sometimes I barley recognize my own reflection. Sometimes I stare in the mirror for hours a day, just pointing out flaws or changes. Sometimes I avoid looking in the mirror all together. Most of the time I don’t even see myself as a human, or too ugly to even be a human. I’ve had thoughts of performing surgery on myself and imagining how perfect I’d be if I done it, but I try not to think about it. Everyday, I watch videos about plastic surgery. Somehow, I feel like all of my problems would be gone if I just changed some of my facial features, like I’d be able to live an actual life. I’d pay any price for it, I don’t care if it could kill me, I’d do it. When I used to go to school, I’d carry out certain ways of getting ready. I’d mainly go to school on days where I felt like I looked like an actual human, most of the times I’d just cry in front of a mirror saying to myself “you’re disgusting.” It’s gotten easier since I’ve stopped going to school, but it still bothers me a lot. Minor inconveniences like catching a person staring at me, or wind blowing in my face and blowing my hair away from it would ruin my day. At lunch and break, I’d sit in a bathroom stall looking at my face, most of the time, I’d look at it and wouldn’t wanna come out, then have to get sent home by teachers because I was too afraid to go into class. I’ve always held back from talking to people about how ugly I feel, especially my parents and doctors. My next appointment is next week, I’ve never talked to any of my doctors about me feeling disgusting, I’ve always just told them that I only feel anxious for no real reason. I think I might tell my doctor this week, maybe then I’ll actually begin to get better. I think most of the anxiety comes from me feeling incredibly ugly, so I think it’s best to work on that. Body dysmorphia is also a thing that people with social anxiety are more likely to have, so I guess it’s safe to say that it’s a possibility. I’m excited to talk to my doctor about this, because I feel like it might be the start of me actually beginning to feel happier again. I just don’t know if I should tell him about the wanting to perform surgery on myself, because he might see that as me having thoughts of self-harm. I usually don’t post anything on sites, but within the past few months, I’ve become more comfortable with talking to people. Anyways, leave a comment if you wanna say anything. (It feels kinda embarrassing saying “leave a comment,” because I know I probably won’t get any. But, thanks for reading anyways.)",1

Cars might drive by but at that time they are usually too busy thinking ""I fucking hate my life for being out this late im so tired"" that they wont pay attention to you.

The worst is, the ""do it often and it will pass"" method does NOT work. As a student living on my own I am often around people, in public. Guess what - each time going outside equals to mild panic attacks, stress, and tons of insecurity. I wanted to travel by myself but I am pretty sure I would get lost immediately or be hopeless.

I’m suppose to meet with him again in two weeks in November. My goal is to face one fear every single day for two weeks until my next session. I started today by walking the campus and meeting a stranger who also told me how lonely they were. Nothing major happened but I initiated the conversation and broke through the first stage of the anxiety. I didn’t waste any time making the first movement today. I’m bracing for these next two weeks so I can return to my therapist with news of improvement. If you’re reading this I know it’s hard as hell out there.

difbcna,"nature, walk"," Some sort of weekly class. I'm not sure about yours, but my local community centres offer TONS of them. Art classes, dance classes, yoga, pilates, weightlifting, music. I started taking weekly ballet classes in an attempt to start getting out there. It was terrifying at first, but I quickly got used to it and actually took various other classes. It gave me a lot of confidence. I think the weekly classes are nice because you sort of know what to expect week after week. You grow comfortable with the people in your classes, which makes it easier to get to know them as opposed to seeing a group of different people every class. And the routine of it is also very nice. It's easier to convince yourself to go knowing that it's just part of your weekly routine. I've also started volunteering once a week for a few hours at an animal rescue. I work on my own for the most part, but talk to the other volunteers occasionally. That's kind of the nature of my volunteer work, but you could volunteer with a food bank or boys  and girls club, which would involve more social interaction. You're getting out there AND making a difference! Generally I think getting out of the house and doing anything is progress, whether you're interacting with other people or not. Because I'm not sure about you or anyone else, but when my social anxiety is bad, I retreat into myself and stay home where I'm comfortable. Just breaking that cycle by going for a short walk around the neighbourhood is a good idea. You could smile and say hello to people as you walk by, which may or may not be difficult for you or practice mindfulness. ",1

This can be anything, no matter how small. Could be a song you like, food, an activity, a person, an item of clothing you like to wear, a place you like to be, doing chores, cleaning, writing, drawing.

drwjf7j,park,"First step is to research therapists. Find one who specializes in Suicide ideation and self harm first and foremost. Use Psychologytoday.com if you need. Once you have a list of some that you seem to like the looks of then start working up the courage to call them. If you can't do it try starting by calling your mom or something to get used to the process of calling people if you have trouble with that. Once you feel comfortable enough (It will never be comfortable but it will feel better) then you call them. You ask to set up and appointment and you show up at that appointment. Don't give up if the first place you call can't see you. Keep trying. Then you keep seeing them. Do your best to be as open and honest as possible and actually try the things they suggest you do no matter how stupid or or useless they seem. These are trained professionals, not someone looking to make you into a fool. With some time you will start feeling more stable. Not better, but stable. Then you start trying to work on finding something you enjoy. Games, movies, music, dogs, reading, helping old ladies cross the street. It really doesnt matter what it is. Just find something that sucks less than the other things and keep doing it. Try and see if there is a way to help the social anxiety while doing that. If you like dogs, go to a dog park or a regular park and ask to pet someones dog. If its movies maybe try to go to a movie store or something and buy/rent/look at a movie. If its music go to a record store and look at what they have. Just something you can do that adds a social element to whatever it is you find you like. And keep pushing that boundary. Hows your hygiene? If you arent showering at least every other day. Start. There is literally not a single excuse for not doing it. It is a small change that can help you feel a bit more fresh of mind. Hell, make that your first step if you think looking for a therapist is too much for you right now. I don't really know how severe your Social anxiety is. I don't know a single thing about you so its hard to really say what you should do but there are some good stepping stones for you. Just to reiterate. 1. Try and find a therapist using Psychologytoday.com, look for someone who focuses in suicide ideation and self harm. 2. Try and find something that is more enjoyable than other things. Something to look forward to doing and just enjoy it and once you are into it more, try and incorporate social aspects into it. 3. Shower at least every other day (every day is preferable) I don't care if you don't think you stink. It will help you feel refreshed every day. It seems like bullshit but trust me. It helps.

Practice the little things first like saying thank you to the cashier (with confidence). You know what you're going to say beforehand and is acceptable to leave immediately after. Be confident, and comfortable in your own skin. Don't let strangers affect your comfort level. Chances are you are not the type of person people will approach because you don't want to be approached. People can sense that with body language. I learned that walking through town not giving a damn about anybody has helped me a lot. It's a negative view but it helps me relax and think, ""nobody cares how weird I'm acting right now as much as I do"" I look forward and avoid eye contact without acknowledging anyone. Occasionally someone will acknowledge me and I do my best to be polite. You can't avoid people, they're gonna be around you you're whole life. So get used to it and do the things you want to do.

My family also never let me go outside at the time so I was really isolated from social for no reason without any way to improve my social skills like any normal person. They even made fun of me of how I apparently can't go to stores to buy food, etc when they were the ones who were really toxic and abusive at me and even banned me from going outside because I apparently have no social skills.

For me personally, I love hiking, reading, running etc. It doesn't matter if I do all of those things alone, they make me happy and I'm happy doing them. Find a hobby you can enjoy and then enjoy it no matter who joins you. Ironically, dedicating myself to personal hobbies has made it slightly easier to talk to people. If anyone ever asks about me, I can talk about my hobbies. Talking about hobbies seems to be way easier than discussing my personal or professional life \(which kind of suck\). ",1

It's supposed to be a party, a time to relax, wind down, socialise. Many shy people get raised on this idea that they need to 'fight' and conquer their fears, but honestly, why even go if the only thing you'll allow yourself to do is fight with your back to the wall when things start getting tough. Nobody else is there to fight a war with themselves, why would you. Taking a moment to breathe in the bathroom or outside with a 'smoke break' or whatever's a perfectly acceptable course of action when your brain is slowly starting to expel exhaust fumes and a short cooldown would make you ready for another burst of chats.

e16dor1,outside," Always remember to breathe. There's (usually) nothing wrong with people looking at you, it's normal. You're looking at them too, after all. Another thing is that they're likely more preoccupied with themselves and how they look than with you, so don't worry too much. It's good to occasionally take a step back and analyze your thoughts. Is there anything actually wrong with your legs, or are you just imagining things? Are they really staring at you, or is it in your head? If you can't deal with going out on your own, try going outside with someone you're comfortable with. This can help to take your mind off of things. Preferably someone who understands you're a bit anxious. Some people say music helps, but personally I don't do that because I feel it distracts me too much when I need to, say, cross a street. So you're going to a new school, then? Look up some tips on first impressions and making conversation. It's not always easy, and you're probably not going to be friends with everyone immediately, but as long as you stay calm and make the effort everything should be alright. Being social is something that (generally) gets easier if you do it often, after all. ",1

e2ux7w9,hiking," I’m a girl and I struggle with this as well with guys. I just want to tell you that your image matters, having unique style, good photos of yourself smiling helps. I’m pretty unapproachable as a girl because of my anxiety, if you look unhappy as a guy, it can be a lot worse because women are taught to be weary of men who seem emotionally unstable (like anger issues etc) (if you have rbf that’s going to work against you massively). It might help to take up some “feminine” hobbies, like knitting, yoga, dance, meditation (a nice neutral hobby). Along with a more outgoing sport (hiking, football, etc). This allows you to be in a space that can actually be helpful for your anxiety, along with interacting with women. Start trying to build friendships with women first, don’t go into relationships thinking they will be romantic, that will take a lot of pressure off of you. Also, don’t refer to women as females as a start. Humanize us as much as possible, educate yourself about women issues, but remain a listener in those spaces. I have yet to have luck with making guy friends, mostly because a lot of things guys find interesting (sports, cars, video games, smoking and drugs) I find boring, and I’ve found that a lot of men I’ve talked to simply aren’t interested in what I like and are less inclined to learn about what I like, I’m willing to learn about a sport a guy really likes, but I tend to sense they really aren’t interested in my own interests. I think a lot of women feel this way, they are expected to change their interests in relationships to suit their partner (not good for either sex, it’s good to find common ground or start something new together). Women are less likely to approach men. If you aren’t approaching us and we have to talk to you, it’s likely the girls you think don’t like you actually are reading you as being uninterested. ",1

After all, remember that she was the one who reached out to you and have nothing to lose if it doesnt work out, all you gain is experience with girls. If the presence of your classmates in this relation is causing so much anxiety (as she knows everyone and would drag attention), mabey try asking her out to something simple.

This is how I try to think about it I know my weaknesses and strengths e.g. I’m good at staying at my house all day isolating myself in my room. I’m bad at my social skills whether it’s small talk, asking for directions, making friends, ect. I’ll myself am going to make a list of things on a spectrum. Via what’s the easiest  and what’s the worst. (Worst)Talking to a random girl on the street vs (easy)maybe walking into the bookstore to check out the newest book selection. Once you figure out the problems it’s much easier to dissect how to fix it. And since I’m bad at everything I’ll have to learn from the bottom. Idk if this is a real quote but “Everything in life is a skill, all you need is determination  and practice to become a master”. For whatever circumstances we didn’t master socializing as children (which is suppose to happen). Socializing is a skill, this is why it’s called “Social Skills” same with any sport or even Humor (great TED talk about this topic). Now since you know the solution which is = Repeated Exposure or Practice. This can be pretty tricky because you anxiety will do everything in its path to say “Go back to your comfort zone”. Idk where I’m going with this, I was trying to end on a good note but... I guess I would try to study your SA or whatever is causing these bad feelings. Since I’m a hermit I’m going to buy tons of Self-Improvement and social skills books and read on how to keep on conversation going, be interesting, those sort of things. Then I’m going to go out and experiment even if my anxiety says “No”. Of course I’ll start slow like maybe first I’ll walk down a park, then I’ll gradually gain the confidence to look someone in the eye, lastly I might smile and greet them while passing by. Baby Steps. Also, documenting in a journal helps. ",1

I was later told by a rather irritated family member how rude I was being by staying out of the way. It was pure lack of understanding on her part (she and everyone-else are much more aware of my SA now) but it really hurt me at the time because there was nothing I could do to change how I felt around others, and the comment stuck with me.

That experience made me very unwilling to try anything again.  and#x200B; I eventually turned to alcohol which worked wonders for my anxiety but eventually led to alcoholism. I was fortunate to go to a rehab center that focused on healing the ""cause"" of the alcoholism, which in my case was social anxiety. For me personally, exercise was one of the biggest helps. Usually aerobic (running) workouts worked better than say lifting weights but it all helped immensely. Also started medication paxil, propananol and klonopin.  and#x200B; I'm married now. Me and my wife were very close friends for 1 year before I made any sort of move. We now joke about how she was waiting for me to do something but this was before going to rehab/starting medication.

But i've been typing this for too long to delete it all so sorry I'm not meaning to rub it in anyones face, I'm just sharing my experience  and#x200B; I'm 17 and have had 3 girlfriends technically but only really count one. In middle school was my first relationship with this girl named C. It started when I asked her to a dance (which was extremely nerve racking), and that was before my SA got too bad. It was a pretty standard relationship. We held hands and hung out. Then we broke up like 2 weeks later. Then at the end of 9th grade I started dating a girl named M. We kinda dropped hints that we liked each other but never did anything about it. A few weeks into summer I mustered up the courage and sent her a long heartfelt text about how I really liked her and whatnot. I wasn't really asking her out, but just making my feelings clear. Then like a week later she asked me out and I said yes. I think we hung out once during our relationship then she dumped me about 2 weeks in with the classic ""It's not you, it's me"" excuse. Fast forward 3 years to the end of summer before 12th grade starts. This girl named D that I kinda knew from school replies to a photo of my dog on IG and we start talking. I really like skateboarding and post a lot of videos of me skating and she complemented me on those. I told her that I could teach her if she wanted and after a little convincing we decided to meet. Initially I was REALLY nervous about meeting her. When I offered to teach her how to skate, I was just being friendly in hopes I might make a new friend to skate with. However she dropped some hints that she liked me which instantly made me 100x more nervous to meet her. I made one of my friends come along because I know he's goofy and would take attention off me if I needed. Anyways the meeting went well and D and I continued to talk and become more friendly. After awhile we both know that we like each other and are basically bf and gf. For some reason D had this idea that someone had to explicitly ask the other person out for it to be a couple. She told me she wanted me to ask her out and I said that it's silly to ask someone to ask you out. If you both want to date each other and both know that you want to date each other, then you're basically bf and gf, no need for someone to ask the other out. Anyways she then asks me out a few weeks later and so I guess that's technically the started of our relationship, but it's whatever. I think we dated for around 5 months. D was the first girl that I ever truly felt like I loved. I genuinely felt like I would do anything for her and that I wanted to be with her forever. Then what felt like out of nowhere, she tells me she's not happy and wants me to do more for her. She wants me to know what she wants without her telling me. I tell her I'll try my best and we continue dating. A week later she dumps me because she just doesn't like me anymore. For a few days I was extremely depressed. I sit through school feeling numb, then I'd come home and lie in bed watching youtube until it was time to fall asleep. I was even somewhat suicidal at some point. She also got mad at me because one of her guy friends threatened to beat the shit out of me if I talked to her and I basically called him a retarded and messed with him a little. Apparently in her mind, me messing with her friend was worse than him threatening to beat me up and so she stopped talking to me as well. At that point I wasn't as depressed but I was still sad. But about a day after she stopped talking to me I suddenly realized that I didn't need her. After I realized that, I instantly became happier. I stopped caring about her and started caring about myself. I started skating more often and talking to friends. It's been about a month since we broke up and I'm feeling better than ever.

Then I didn't push myself for another 3/4 of a year (give or take). Finally, about 1.25 years ago, I started pushing myself a lot more. Everyday I started writing resumes for jobs. I made a goal of going hiking and saying hi to every stranger that I passed. I went to fast food places on a whim just to practice. After a few months I got a job. I then got busy with that and didn't do much for a while. Then I finally got the courage to try dating and found a girlfriend after a few months.

Yoga and meditation really do help, by opening up space in the body and breathing consciously, it allows more room for different thoughts to come into your mind.

I’ve also been consciously using weed and psychedelic mushrooms to open up more too, but I’d really recommend getting into a good headspace through yoga and meditation in order to be more receptive to what the plant can teach you. I find that (as with anything) it’s important to not over indulge in the plant medicines and to allow your body to find its equilibrium sober, it helps the lessons sink in more. By following my feelings and focusing more on my own interests, I’ve started to feel more comfortable in my own skin, and I’ve been going to events by myself (something that was unimaginable a few years back) and meeting so many other likeminded beautiful people 😊 Be kind to yourself, it takes patience.

f2t3f3l,"running, run","I have problems with finding motivation to chores, but I am doing this anyway. Usually when I have to do something, I write it down and later when I have more energy, I am doing those stuff. Its nice feeling when you remove something from the list to do. Running I dont perceive as a chore. I run regularly for 7 years. Also I am planning to meditate again. My plan to improve my social confidence is to just be myself and dont pretend. Some people already have seen that I am toxic, but I feel more confident and free.",1
f4p7t09,"running, run","I was in the exact same situation in between my undergrad and masters. There were a lot of little things that helped me. 1. In the end I got my mom to help force me to apply to stuff. Making a deadline with someone helped to motivate me to finally do stuff. Honestly, this was the trigger that got me started applying. Get your boyfriend or someone else you trust to help you make those calls. Even if it's just them sitting beside you while you do it. (I know that this in itself can be stressful :( 2. Mindfulness meditation has helped me. ""Mindfulness is the psychological process of purposely bringing one's attention to experiences occurring in the present moment without judgment"". Basically, practice feeling your emotions without judgement. Just let them flow through, accept them, let them be, and finally understand that they don't have to control you. Honestly pretty difficult to be completely mindful but the idea and a little bit of practice has helped me out. I would recommend looking up mindfulness on a few websites and see where it goes. 3. I set up a time every day where I would go and focus on applying, writing CVs, emailing people etc. It usually only ended up being like 4 hours a day. But that was enough to get some stuff done. 4. I went running every day. You don't have to run but I would suggest finding a little hobby that can keep you happy. 5. Counseling has never really helped me but it has helped other people. Could always give it a shot.",1
f6x8d04,running," Yo dude. When you have this presentation? When I want to be relaxed during more harder and stressful stuff, I began with smaller things to build my self-confidence. After stressful situations I am relaxed and happy, I can do harder stuff without any problems then. What you can do before it? shopping? maybe something more difficult, depends on your level. Maybe there are some stuff when after doing them you are less anxious and more confident? My stuff= earlier socialization or running/exercising before harder tasks. You can also try melissa or some mild stuff to relax you a bit. Personally I dont take any pills. ",1

fjp26d3,running,"Tbh it didn't help me too much. In my opinion the best way in the long term: To stop overthinking is just doing something social over and over again. With time you are going with the flow and stop overthinking so much, because you have no time for that if you are preparing and going for next social exposure. Like, constantly be on the move. With time your body stops reacting with stress. In the short term: hm.. you can try to socialize after running. After doing something less socially bothering to gain confidence and to warm up first. 5HTP (serotonin booster, you can get it without seeing a doctor).",1
fjs1xne,"walk, outside, outdoors, park"," Go out for a walk once a day additionally and slowly start increasing the time you spend outside. Try to go a different route everytime if it's not causing too much stress. If you live in a bigger town or city, go shopping instead of online shopping. Call some businesses and just ask random questions about their product. Start to go to a bar, at first during the week, later on weekends too. You don't have to talk to people just drink one drink and then go home after half an hour. Start doing sport, either outdoors or at a gym. If you trust her, talk to your friend about your problems. If you can, try to take your dog to a dog park or something like that. Try to make smalltalk with the other dog owners. These are just some ideas, but please take it slow and don't overburden yourself. The key is to slowly expand your comfort zone and your optimal performance zone without going into the danger zone. Ideally you would do this under supervision from a professional, like a therapist. If the topic is interessting to you, search for exposure therapy. Hope I could help! ",1
foozy2a,walk," It'll pass and get better like it always doesnt with social anxiety but ours brains will probally have to relearn some stuff again. I also felt this a bit a few days also when I was getting some icecreams I felt like the shopkeepers were staring at me, maybe there were but its ofc never in a malicious way like we think it is. But this is somethign thats a basic task and something ive moved past a while ago, so I had deffo gone a bit backwards but its ups and downs always so im trying to keep positive. At least go out for a walk everyday! its allowed and its good for your mind, and everyone is out for walks atm as its the only freedom we get during isolation so if u keep doing that a few times youll have to come across people and at least make eye contact and say hello to them. So that will make it easier and keep things tying over till we go back to normal. ",1
fvutio9,"walk, outside"," Do you have a dog? If so, take your dog for a walk and talk to all the other pet owners. That's honestly what I do. Or go for a walk alone if you feel comfortable, and try socializing with other people out exercising and tell them you're looking for a walking/exercise partner. A lot of people are exercising outside more since gyms are still closed. ",1
fxieve6,walk, Definitely get one if you think your up for it. I have a dog with me and it helps me out through a lot of things. If your also in a depressive state it’s good company to have to vent to and pet. And it will also give you an excuse to get fresh air since it needs to be walked. ,1
g0ebvep,"running, run"," I feel like this a lot of the time too but I've noticed it helps when I focus on improvable skills. I beat myself up about not being charismatic enough or smart enough, but you know what I can improve on? Running, painting, writing, piano, etc. It has been sooo good for my self esteem to focus on activities like these. It's like that cliche saying about only focusing on being better than you were yesterday -- except it's sorta true lol. It's certainly not something that comes naturally but when you start setting goals and meeting them, it's incredibly rewarding and wholesome. I've never felt particularly good at anything either but now I can say that I run and that's better than nothing. ",1
g28q1y6,"jog, outside, running"," something that worked for me is, i would put in some ear buds, sunglasses and go for a jog. nobody talk's to you because of the earbud's (and the music will help distract you) and nobody tries to make eye contact because your eyes are covered. this will help condition you to outside more, with the bonus perk of all the mental health benefits of running.

g2sklqo,nature," It does help reducing my social anxiety. When I don't watch porn, I don't compare myself to other, better people and I feel less inferior and therefore less anxious. Anxiety is mainly triggered by inferiority complexes in my case. Also, when not fapping everyday for hours, you'll have more time to get social exposure or be in nature which both helps for social anxiety. Also more energy and slightly higher testosterone levels, resulting in less anxiety. ",1
g2tmpnn,run,"Wow , exactly like me , same age but I’m male. Also got bullied In school and literally no one calls me. But even so , it ain’t so bad. Find music you like , watch series you want and read books YOU want , without any feedback from the others when you are lonely like me. Around 2-3 times in a week I go to run to release some pressure. It makes me anxious to run past people so my mind just push me even faster to escape from them. I just came to a solution - if I can’t connect to people, I need to fill that loneliness. If not - I’m going to get depressed, so that’s at least one way to make my well-being a little better. Also, I can’t stand social websites like Instagram or Facebook because of the photo stuff and the phony people so I just deleted my accounts, I don’t even have any profile pick in WhatsApp. Just make yourself feel a little better one small step at a time. Good luck!",1

Hey guys quick question, I’ve recently discovered that if I run before a social event I’m the most confident person ever (especially with a beta blocker). But in the morning before exercise, I get watery eyes in public, feel ‘hollow’ and struggle to keep eye contact without crying. What’s going on?",1
