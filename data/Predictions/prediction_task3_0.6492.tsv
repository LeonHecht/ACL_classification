At some point, high school was over and we all went our own separate ways (I studied media design for a few years which I graduated from early 2019). But I also declined all those. Just didn't give it much thought. Late into high school we also got offered the options to go for a trip to the Czech Republic, after that a sailing camp, etc. Okay, so years ago back in high school the first year or so I made a few friends quite quickly, but I never really spent time with them outside of school at the time, it's like it didn't even cross my mind, and when they offered me the choice I was like ""well, I can just see them at school can't I?"". Stuff stayed pretty inactive after that, but eventually one of them sent me a message asking me if I wanted to leave from our (now their) WhatsApp group which I was always in, since they pretty much exclusively used it to plan vacations and stuff now, and I never replied anyway (no bad blood or anything, they even said they hoped we'd meet again). The years after that went mostly the same in this regard, I also met a few new friends along the way, and at most I went to one of my friend's place like 3-4 times or so.

dyfhfei	It's never too late to try something else and to learn something new. What's obvious is that what you've been trying so far, whatever coping skills you have, aren't cuttin' it. Time for 'out with the old, in with the new'. At this point, pretty much \*anything\* you can decide to do different is going to already be better than sticking with the familiar, predictable rut\-enabling routine, aside from actively harming yourself. One meaningful change could be to get your ass in therapy for this, and to approach it with a clear motivation to share your thoughts, get advice, and to assume that what you'll be told may just actually work. Dare to doubt that the way you think about the world may not be as self\-evident as it seems, because you likely WILL feel tempted to dig your heels in and defend doing more of what you're already doing \- more of what's obviously not contributing to your growth or happiness. Dare to assume that you're wrong, because you have a mental health problem that specifically likes to make things seem scarier, heavier, harder, more impossible and hopeless than they really are. Anticipation is almost always worse than the actual thing. Try to let your dissatisfaction fuel you, knowing you can be, feel, do much more than your current mental state is telling you. The question isn't 'whether' you can improve, the question is simply 'how', and looking for that 'how' is allowed to be a journey all by itself. Try stuff, learn stuff, discover things about yourself you may not know yet. Give yourself the chance to be surprised by just how much you haven't learned yet about how to properly look after yourself mentally, about what real self\-esteem can feel like, about how many things you worry about aren't worth worrying over, and how you can self\-regulate your emotions to the point where they stop getting in your way as much. I'm sure you're not even remotely graduated from the class of 'how to live life gud', so tackle that seriously, try to be open to learning new things, and learning how to set a pace that works for you \(including that tough thing of being patient with yourself and having healthy, realistic expectations\). You're allowed to fuck it up along the way, just keep swimming anyway. As long as you don't sit down and quit \(mind, taking a break to recharge isn't quitting or losing\), you won't have lost. This stuff is a life's work, and it's never too late to get crackin' on it. Better to learn how to improve your finesse, experience and life skills now, than to be afraid and look back when you're seventy, regretting that you didn't have the courage now, at the time you're already realizing something needs to be done. If you can't get professional therapy right now, then start with what you CAN do. Start giving yourself small challenges to go from a 95&amp;#37; shut\-in to maybe a 50&amp;#37; shut\-in overtime. Consult free services where you can. Look up relaxation techniques. Buy or borrow a book on ACT therapy, pretty sure that'll be a good investment. Nudge where you can, one thing at a time. Small things add up. At some point you might feel like you can stand a chance job\-hunting \(and I'm sure you have the skills, just not the nerve right now\). Every little thing you can do to go against the grain of this downward spiral will be a victory and take you a bit closer to getting out of this situation. <sep> Keyword: swim	0
n62zgv	After I had a walk along the lake and several anxiety attacks due to how many people were around I decided to back to the trainstation and return to the safety and comfort of my home. As I walked some lady was at the parking meter and approached me cause she didn't have the change to pay, the meter only took 50rp. I was on a field trip with my class to this Photography museum and after we were done there we had the afternoon to ourselves. I was really perplexed and almost wanted to run but sadly I freeze in such situations and after I gathered myself I gave her 2 half francs in exchange for a whole one and she thanked me.

7cizal	Hey everyone, so I have a little bit of social anxiety that manifested itself when I moved to a new smallish town for college (a typical college town). I am a transfer student and missed the boat on making friends freshman year, and I do not want to be in a sorority, but it seems like 90% of the girls in my classes are in one. I just don't have many friends. I really just don't feel like I fit in, and i'm tired of wasting my energy trying to make friends with people who seem to not be interested in being friends. School is going well, I'm kicking ass at my internship, I'm making money, My hobbies are modeling, hiking, and gardening, and I like not having distractions. To be honest, I sort of enjoy not having lots of friends, it's less of a distraction, I'm more productive, and I can do whatever I want. <sep> Keyword: boat, hiking, garden	2

ddzv6jm	* Start running along with your weights. * Supplments: I recommend fish oil, magnesium, vitamin d3, and a good chelated B-Complex. 20 minutes if you don't have much time. Gently guide yourself back if you feel yourself drifting off, and always be loving and forgiving. It's a feeling unique to running that you can't get from lifting. Just practice mindfulness; put on some nature sounds (running water is best) on headphones and breath normally, focusing on the sounds. Only water or tea, not counting supplements like magnesium, during fasting. Running is SO nice, I always feel refreshed afterwards. <sep> Keyword: walk, nature, running, running, Running, running	1

I've been suffering from this as long as I can remember and I'm just 17. I'm a decent guy. I have a pretty good sense of humor. But no one knows that. Surprisingly, everyone knows me at my school and they even hang out with a couple of guys like me. I could be one of the guys they hang out with but the only thing holding me back is my anxiety. I go out to play Basketball at odd times just to avoid other people. 2 weeks ago this guy who's pretty popular in my grade asked me something and I took 10 seconds to get a word out and even then I stuttered a bit.

eppqb6f	Omg I was literally thinking of making a post about social anxiety and getting a job but I stumbled upon your post and we think too much alike. I have the same fear about getting a real job and moving out on my own. I just technically graduated from uni but I have one more class to complete. I’m thankful of living in a city with a lot of diverse opportunity and I was able to become a dog walker, and really it’s become my passion and the only thing I ever wanna do in terms of earning income. My mom thinks I’ll get a full-time corporate job when I’m officially done with all my college credits, but that’s not what I have in mind at all. I have this hopeful plan in the back of my head to keep being a dog walker for as long as I can and maybe try pick up some freelance work cuz lord knows that I refuse to work a 9-5 that involves toxic office co-workers and/or superficial happy hours. Ik relying on a part time job for my career path isn’t responsible at all but I’m honestly just improvising tf out of this whole adulting thing atm. and I’m also the legit same when it comes to seeing a job I might be able to. Ever since my last semester ended few weeks ago, I been religiously looking on Indeed and other job sites and favoriting different jobs that are realistic enough for me but being afraid to apply cuz I think in my head what if I actually get the job/interview and can’t come through with it. Like I get all excited and motivated when I see a jobs requirements that looks doable but then I forget interviews always make me anxious like a bitch or feel that I won’t work well with co workers all thx to my SA... ugh <sep> Keyword: walk, walk	0

I immediately began thinking back through everything and replaying who heard us and tried to figure out if anyone tried to tell me to stop.

agqze9	Talked to a Someone for the First Time in a Year (or so), Now Feeling More Depressed than I have in a While.. (First post, sorry in advanced for formatting) Some background: I (23M) had been commuting to Community College for about 3 years now, and just now started my first semester at a university as a junior. I started this past Tuesday but had been sick through the beginning of the week as well as sleep-deprived (mostly due to anxiety but also sickness). Anyways, today I meet this girl due to circumstance and we start walking around campus and talking. After talking for a bit I learned she graduated high school pretty young and was already a senior (from what a gathered this girl was only 19, maybe 20); and of course on top of that, I found her attractive, so already I'm already struggling to hold conversation because I just find her amazing. We keep talking and she doesn't seem too bothered by me, (we ended getting lunch together and talking for another hour before she had to leave for class). Just as a side-note this is the third girl I have talked to in college and the other two were almost exactly like this girl; they had all been through pretty traumatic shit in their past, this girl had lost her boyfriend (I didn't ask how, as to not be rude) and her mother was diagnosed with cancer. So, I just had this immense respect for her as I had for these other two women on top of everything else mentioned earlier. &amp;#x200B; So I end up exchanging numbers with this girl which is where my already growing anxiety just goes ballistic. I make one shitty joke, begin to think about how poorly it went with the other two girls, start thinking about how awkward I must have been at lunch; since I was sick and sleep deprived I wasn't exactly sharp, on top of the way I had almost immediately felt about this girl. Just, shit starts piling up which in turn starts making me feel more depressed and anxious than normal ; and when I get back from school I get home and my body aching, I have a headache and I can't stop thinking about this girl. I keep thinking what's wrong with me for being here again; and, even if it were possible, do I need a friend or something more (I had just recently lost my best friend of 20 years and had been feeling more lonely than ever this past year), so I'm just currently a mess; I honestly just don't want to mess this up and be friends with this girl but can't help feel like I did something wrong or said something really stupid (we've stopped texting each other so I'm probably reading into that too much as well), but I'm really unsure what to do. Feeling like shit, and just looking for some advice on how to deal with this anxiety and the condition I'm in. &amp;#x200B; Sorry for the long read and thank you for your time/advice. <sep> Keyword: walk	2

mtknre	Family Reunion in 2 weeks... and I'm terrified.. (M/20) 𝗦𝗼𝗼𝗼 this is my first post here, sorry if it's extra long, don't really know what I'd be getting by posting this but I just needed somewhere to express myself since everyone here seems super chill. After getting evicted, becoming homeless and couch surfing, I lost confidence in every aspect of my life. All of this combined doesn't mesh well at the family cookout. But it all changed when we 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 hit financial hardships in middle school. Every time I go to one I'm extremely uncomfortable, it's like everyone around me has a degree in small talk and I missed the course. I immediately shut down even though I want to be outspoken, but I literally have nothing to say. I just sit there in agony wishing I could either socialize better or just run away. I'd never really grew up around much of my family, just my grandparents I was close to who unfortunately passed away when I was young. It's like I'm trying to fulfill an expectation they have of me, and never achieving it makes me hate myself for it. Not sure where to start besides the fact that anxiety has risen 1000% ever since I was informed that we'll be going to an outdoor birthday party for one of the elders of our family (everyone's coming together so basically a reunion.) They sort of talk down to you since you're quiet instead of an equal. Which would be great... if I didn't feel like an outsider in my own family. <sep> Keyword: outdoor, surfing, cookout, run	0
rt57le	But I still developed zero bond with any of these people in my age range with whom I had a lot in common and was in the middle of the wilderness doing challenging things with every day for a month. I also went on this group backpacking trip program last summer and I remember certain people being very shocked after being around me for a week or so to hear that I hadn’t spoken with pretty much anyone other than my parents for like 6+ years. I know I am very naïve and rely on self deprecating humor and just giggle too much in general out of nervousness, and so people begin to treat me like I’m stupid or immature and I don’t like that feeling. My boyfriend and my therapist have both described me as being very personable when they each first met me as I was raised to be very polite.

I was actually sort of baffled by research showing that kids that score low on the HSP trait can encounter a scary acting unfriendly adult, and minutes later forget all about it and play happily with other kids in the playground. also gets taken to heart way more and results in more negative outcomes for HSP's than average. <sep> Keyword: playground	2

ju5efr	Also growing up unaware of mental illnesses other than the classic TV portrayal, my mum thought nothing of it and chalked it up to me being a shy child. I never knew how (still don't) to make friends properly, or how to approach people. I'd always experience the dread, the choking feeling in my throat, the heavy weight on my chest, the nausea, withdrawing into my own head, and feeling as if I'm underwater. I've always experienced pretty bad anxiety (mainly social anxiety), especially when I had to go for school camps, or school orientations where we'd be grouped with strangers and generally expected to be active and excited etc. It's obviously irrational and stupid, but I always ended up feeling awkward, antisocial and friendless, and worse - like I was viewed as such. Of course I never thought of this as anxiety, I just knew I was scared and that I wanted to run away no matter what. This is despite the fact that I knew I was only going to the doctor's in order to be able to skip school for those few days, but the nausea made it easier for me to convince the dr. To that end, when it comes to things like orientations or camps, my extreme anxiety often led to terrible nausea, and I'd ultimately just end up going to the doctors, getting a medical certificate and skipping those few days. <sep> Keyword: camps, run, camps	3

d8nmg73	You should tell the university staff about this,they can offer counseling and from what i know,you can take off a semester or a year due to sickness(in this case social anxiety).If it becomes too unbearable,i strongly suggest that you put uni on a hold for now,get back home,get some therapy and then return.In the meanwhile,try to attend classes and make everything possible to distract yourself and keep your mind entertained:browse reddit,9gag,youtube,listen to music,read a book etc.Anything basically that can help.Also,hang out with your partner as much as possible,talk to him about your issues,it really helps when you have someone to vent off to. Best of luck to you! Even if you don't know how to cook,try!Read a recipe and practice at night when no one can disturb you.Take a walk in evening,try to exercise abit everyday so you don't become trapped in your room,which trust me,it won't do you any better.Try at least to do something productive every day and you'll feel somewhat accomplished and happier with yourself. <sep> Keyword: walk	1

Do some pushups.nnThis will get you outside your mind:registered:where the depression exists:registered:and into your body.nnThe next step, shortly after you exercise, is to take some kind of SMALL action. Everyone you pass by, wave and acknowledge them. Go for a short jog. I've learned that the best way to solve depression is to take baby steps. Lift some weights. Maybe someone will be sitting on a bench. Maybe you can wave to that person and acknowledge them.

Reason I say this is because they are much more relaxing to be around, mine was an older gentleman who was very reassuring and classy. If you get a relationship of trust with your instructor you’ll be less anxious. As for tips on relaxing behind the wheel, first master residential areas with less traffic to get the basics down perfectly. Then transition to higher traffic areas, practice left hand turns, merging into lanes, memorizing traffic light layouts etc. Leave the highway for last, drivers are at their worst out there, if you realize 90% of the risk is other drivers out there you’ll realize driving is just muscle memory.

I'm always afraid I'll have to just stand up and walk away to avoid crying, and what either stops me or haunts me is what is probably going through their head if/when it happens. People that probably share or can at least empathize with your position. The two extremes are they think they did something wrong and I don't want to hurt their feelings, or that they're confused by my actions and think I'm strange.

I decided to go and my plan was to just smoke and chill. I feel like I made a bad first impression and I feel his friends think I’m weird/lame. It’s hard to talk to people and make convos when you struggle with social anxiety and the weed made it worse. I’m trying to be more social but I don’t think I meant to make friends Anyways did I make the right decision of not going to their bonfire meet-up?

Throughout this time I've gradually lost my social skills and I haven't been able to make any new friends. However, in the past couple months, I actually want to make new friends opposed to before when I was too anxious to talk to anyone. I go to this skatepark most days and there's this group of people that I want to introduce myself too, they all seem like cool people but I have no idea what to go up and say to these people. I say hi to one of those people everyday when I get there but it hasn't gone further than that yet. &amp;#x200B; If anyone has any tips or can help I would appreciate it so much, this feeling of loneliness is starting to settle in and its made it a hard few months. <sep> Keyword: skate	3

I think if you guys usually hang out doing activities, that's probably better than just sitting in a restaurant or bar as there is more pressure on the conversation in a restaurant or a bar where you are sat facing each other the whole time.

(doesn't mean that I didn't need time to reflect) and for some reason people appreciated me , but after that things became different , I always had a really quiet voice , I guess it was linked to unconscious anxiety (which is ironic considering my previous statement) my mother was so over protective , she was also an introvert and she was REALLY PROTECTIVE , we also live in countryside , there are a lot of people in this place but our neighbors are actually relatives , so I spent more time playing with the neighbors kids rather than meeting new people , they were nice , sometimes they acted total dicks , but most of the time they were really welcoming and nice but my mother only would let us (me and my brothers) go outside for 1 hour and then come back home to either study or play with our same old toys or watch the tv (which had nothing interesting in it) or just stare at wall until the day ends As my dad spends most the day in work with very little income , and my mom with her overprotection I became less confident about myself even with people close to me , another thing is that we didn't socialize a lot , years could pass and we didn't go in a family picnic or do an activity as a family... it even made me more detached that I kind of got the ""Avoidant"" attachment style Fun fact !

I went through the exact same thing last year. I wouldn't leave the house without a water bottle or rescue remedy. So go for a walk for five minutes, then come home.

At some point I kinda started considering doing that, but it was like really late (we were like 3-4 years into high school at that point) and in the meanwhile my friends have all been at each other's places, except for me. I have this very much too. In high school I had a great group of friends but I really only saw them during school, at the time I just simply didn't really give visiting them outside of school much thought. Never really saw them again after high school either, outside of two small gatherings.

lx686w	And now that I'm here, realizing that in being soft spoken and quiet, and in turn something of a loner, I feel like I self sabotaged most of the relationships in my life that could have helped me through hard times, and that maybe I was the one perpetuating what I thought were toxic relationships by not being able to express myself well and making other people annoyed at me, to which I, in the end, just walk away because it's too much for me to deal with... most of the times I write for myself to deal with my emotions and this is the first time writing to where other people might see this, because I feel like I'm in need of other people to talk to about this stuff, and idk help to figure out how to make friends... Every time I've hung out with someone new, I thought things went well since I'm usually pretty happy go lucky and try to talk about stuff the other person wants to talk about... I didn't even start to think about how conversations can be important and can help build relationships, until these past few years, and from a young age felt that it didn't really matter what I said, since I've always been called soft spoken and quiet. I feel like I've had many opportunities to make new friends and kinda made one through work, and feel like there have been many people I thought could make really good friends. I felt relieved to move to a new city and get away from my college and I thought making new friends would be easier, since I like to do outdoor things like go on hikes, which is popular here, and I usually like to talk to people. I'm generally freaked out to post anything online, but I feel like I have to get this off my chest somewhere, and I spend too much time on Reddit so it seems like a good place... TL;DR I'm going crazy because I feel like social anxiety is ruining my life. Of the people I consider friends, they always talk about their other friends, and things they are doing together... even through this whole pandemic... and I get upset with myself because I don't have any other friends here, and I get sad because I like to do things that involve socializing like hiking, going on bike rides, or just hanging out, but I get so afraid to try and make new friends to do that stuff, and usually just do things alone. Several times I've tried to make new friends, usually because someone else introduced me, and I painfully initiated making plans, and maybe we've met up and done something outside once or a few times, but they eventually seem less interested in spending time together. We have managed to keep our relationship stable through the pandemic, even with a few rough spots. <sep> Keyword: outdoor, hikes, hiking, bike, outside, walk	0

5pvluo	"I have overcome SA. Some practical tips.. Hi guys. I'm currently 21, and I have overcome SA. It's been a process of 3 years, but I have got out of it and I want to tell you some practical tips I've applied to myself. 1.- Identify people that can help you. When I came to university, I was outcast by absolutely everyone. But you can find some (many) people that can accept you. People that didn't talk to me and now are my friends. That was really surprising: when you become interesting and they enjoy your company, they forget when you where ""the lonely one"". And then, when you overcome SA, you can meet new people that know you from zero. 2.- Change. We all like interesting people. And you have to realize that: you wouldn't like someone that doesn't have anything to say, and the same goes the other way. See your ""extra free time"" as an advantage and get some hobbies: sports, instruments, etc. i.e. 2 summers ago I started swimming (alone) and learning about all that world, that is a very appealing topic to others. I also bought some dumbbells and started working out at home. Make a plan and stick to it, and wake up every morning realizing that it's worth it. If you become interesting, people will come to you. 3.- Stop thinking about others THIS way. I'm going to write something that really drove me crazy. I made my first ""uni friend"" (I mean, only mates but It was the first person I could talk to) and I didn't stop looking at ""last time on"" on WhatsApp, thinking about ""should have many friends"", ""I'm not among them""... until I did stop. The same with FB, twitter... And I felt really great. I think one of the bad things of SA is that when you meet someone you are really obsessed with that person. And maybe he/she moves away from you and it really hurts. Try to make many friends: don't stay comfortable with some person/group. This is really important, repeat it to yourself in your high moments. 4.- Happy face. Play some inspirational video or something similar every morning. Not a metaphor: do it. I noticed a lot of change when I started laughing and walking with a happy face. In others and in myself. 5.- Make a smooth transition. I.e. f you wear Tracksuit don't start wearing suit and tie tomorrow. If before I said ""don't obsess with FB"", now don't upload 500 photos of your first party after 1 month since your last post. I was too concerned that people started thinking I was weird because of changing my behavior. Do it smoothly. 6.- Think about conversations as a theater. People don't have a radar that detects who has SA and not. If you feel too nervous even prepare the conversation. I remember that the first days I used to think what I was going to say first. If I met someone that liked football, though I don't like it, I looked the last news. Once you do it some time, you won't need it. 7.- Don't worry. Thoughts hurts us too much. Relativize everything. Sit down one day and think about it. What happens if there's a long silence in a conversation? Nothing. Even in the worst case, if he thinks you are not worth it because you can't give small talk, there are millions of people out there. What is worrying is that that thought blocks you in every single conversation. What happens if you go to a party, you are alone and can't talk to anyone? Nothing, you go home and no one will be laughing ""oh, he's gone hahah"". What is worrying is that you miss every party because of that. Sorry for my English, I'm from Italy. This forum has helped me a lot, so I think I owed this. I can help with any question. <sep> Keyword: swim, walk"	1
e3vqz5e	Can you reduce your work hours? Or maybe apply for a part time position on another ward? I know with my own anxiety levels I would find working full time extra draining. nnThe good thing about nursing is usually there are various shifts available and some flexibility of hours. Would working night shift be less busy? nnWould visiting elderly people in their home, a more mobile position in the community be a better job? It would be mainly 1-1 and you get to drive to each persons home giving you time for some fresh air and a short break. Or something else community based, mental health related or disability? nnI found working in disability with only one other co-worker on shift to be good. That was a community home setting (day services I couldn't do as it was very socially demanding and more like a school setting). It was the only job I lasted longer than a year in (4 years part time total). You could get to take people out into the community, go for drives or shopping. Helping people who need support the most. Once I worked a shift with a registered nurse who said she prefers to work in disability care/support because it is a less stressful job. Plus all your medical knowledge helps a lot as some people with disabilities have complex care needs.nnYou're not the only one feeling this way. It is manageable and I think you're in a good career no matter what happens. <sep> Keyword: fresh air	0

dxwozss	Then the best thing you can do is to keep working on ways to get and keep that social anxiety in check, really :) To try and nudge your comfort zone bit by bit, to keep reminding yourself the things you truly want to do aren't even a smidge as shameful as the anxiety tells you it is, that you're worth taking these little risks to open up your world more and more, one step at a time. If the social anxiety isn't the real you that's underneath, then keep believing, keep fighting, keep respecting the person you are even with the anxiety making things more difficult. Coming across as awkward might sound like the worst thing in the world at first, but it's never stopped other people who aren't socially anxious from doing what they want either. So, why should you care? I know you can't just turn off these irrational feelings, but you can keep practicing, keep building better mental habits and coping skills to counter it, to help the anxiety become just occasional background noise and not hold you back all the time anymore. Just keep swimming, and get professional support if you don't know how to proceed anymore, you're worth it! <sep> Keyword: swim	0

The next day, I went to work, did my couple of hours, went home, and started texting her again. We agreed to go to the dog park the next day(Saturday) and continued chatting until 11:30 pm when I told her I was going to sleep since I was going to work the next day for a few hours. We drove to a different parking lot and found a picnic table right next to the pond and ate there. We finalized the plan for the dog park and even decided we would get food and eat there. We sat and ate and talked. We should be going hiking this coming weekend(will probably end up making a post about that as well).

Being deluded into thinking that someone finds you interesting and has common interests in you, to only find out they want nothing more than sex and when you tell them no, I ""lead them on."" This is why I'm so terrified of making friends. I had what I thought was a ""friend"" for 2 years. We did everything together and had each others backs until I started dating someone that he knre and he started texting me saying he could ""never respect a whore like me."" I was so shocked to think after 2 years of friendship that he only kept me around I hopes he would fuck me. I haven't had an actual friend in 10 years and I had an abusive boyfriend who was the only person out there who would hang out with me, and he drunkenly told me I was a ""slutty bitch who had to fuck for friendship"" when I was open about him being the only person in my life for years. I just want to kill myself because I'm female. I can't find female friends because I get nervous, and I can't find male friends because they don't truly want to be my friend. I've come to terms that I will never be anything more than annoying and boring and I am not interesting at all. I get so nervous when I talk to people and already have the assumption within 2 minutes of talking that they hate me. I..... just want someone in my life and I've been trying for 10 years.

dxdrhqn	At a third level this develops into a real sense of self-identity (bdag 'dzin), a conceptual structure or conception of oneself as a specific entity to which various properties are attached. It is unreal and an illusion, and yet, even though it is unreal and illusory, things continue and events continue to occur in the stream of consciousness. The following is a massive quote (sorry!) The self is empty and without any inherent existence, and yet events occur and the world process goes on and on. The skandhas are not entities or things, but evolving structures or processes that change in the stream of consciousness from moment to moment. This on-going and unending process of identifying is the actual significance of the skandhas or the aggregates of consciousness which form the basis for Buddhist psychology. Thus, from moment to moment, there exist a plurality of egos or selves representing this process of identifying with each thought, emotion, feeling, impulse, and perception that arises into the stream of consciousness. [19] This initial alienated subjectivity then evolves into a secondary level which postulates the real existence of a subject which grasps or apprehends what is thought to exist outside of itself. [20] However, if these processes of the skandhas are put under close observation by way of introspection, it is indeed discovered that there exist here no entity or abiding substance inhering in them. [21] This sense of the self, called the ego, which is the basis for the apprehending and appropriating of the kleshas, is a mere phantasm lacking any inherent existence. and so on. from [this book I’m reading at the moment ](and there was a short section concerning the nature of our ego. “ Once this fundamental dichotomy of being has been created at the primary level by ignorance (ma rig-pa), then a process of evolution unfolds. <sep> Keyword: nature, outside, stream, stream, stream	0

I never really learned how to make friends outside of school, because those places were convenient and I didn't have to do much initiating. I was just put into a room and the people that were there became my friends. So, a little backstory. Sure, I had friends, but I rarely hung out with them outside of class. The league that I joined goes to this one bar after every game(I don't drink, but, luckily, my teammates don't hassle me about it, which is partly why I enjoy hanging around them). These two guys came in and started talking to one of my female teammates who was sitting right next to me, asking some questions and saying something about her about riding the mechanical bull (the bar has a patio with one that we always sit next to).

dpfdpp	"Using ""masks"" to make it easier. First of all, I (20/M) have never been diagnosed with social anxiety or anything, I'm can even be quite a sociable person now. I do however experience a lot of the symptoms of social anxiety. However, I noticed something during my social interactions : It gets really easier when i'm talking or doing something as ""not only myself"". As an example, earlier, we were leading a group of kayakers (we're all around the same age) so I was not ""only myself"", but also one of the people supervising. And it was much easier to talk and do things and being more outgoing because it's kind of like I had a reason to act/talk as I did. But as soon as we were out, I was ""just myself"" again, and then I get much more distant, barely talk or only to people I know well. Other example: I worked this summer in a hospital. When I was with patients, it was easy to talk because I'm not 'myself' but a member of the staff instead. But when I was with my colleagues, I suddenly barely talk, overthink every single thing and stay apart. So I was wondering if anyone experiences the same thing or if someone had any advice on how to use this to help me get less socially awkward when i'm ""only myself"". <sep> Keyword: kayak"	2

cq2gdx	**Over time, you will lose your fear of confrontation and that is the fundamental of herderism. A far cry from riding on a horse into battle, but I promise you, simple, subtle acts such as these will trigger the same herder response within you. Assert your dominance. Because if it isn’t you, it probably won’t be anyone else for a while. But I believe that we all have a herder somewhere in our ancestry, and that herder or those herders in our gene pool have been suppressed by this culture of being non-assertive and being overly sensitive. By doing that, you might be making life easier for the next guy in their 20s who they deal with and feel like they can just walk all over them without consequence. If someone is going to try and fight you over something like telling them to put their trash where it belongs or not to cut in line, then obviously they’re the one with a problem, and you can walk away knowing that whatever you are going through in life, at least your ego isn’t so fragile as to become offended by a simple word of criticism. It could simply be calling out someone who you see loitering to put their trash in a bin, telling someone who cut in line to get in the back where everyone else started or telling your rude, distant coworker to tone it down a notch. It will build your herder-derived “toughness muscle” and weaken your fear of confrontation. Now of course you may be wondering, in instances like these, even if you are not aggressive or confrontational in your approach, you will never know how the other person will respond. Part of the reason being that in our Buddhist household, the distinction between being defensive and aggressive is somewhat subtle, to say the least. <sep> Keyword: riding, horse, walk, walk, pool	0

g3p3lva	Wow, we are so similar because I have the same exact thoughts guilt and burden about wasting my early 20s and not feeling accomplished. I’m turning 23 in November (shudders) but I too have a very very sad resume. If it makes you feel slightly better, my only real work experience is being a dog walker and then one unpaid internship from 2018. Thanks to social anxiety and my parents sheltering me too much, I can’t help but be so embarrassed that a high schooler has a better employment record than me. I also can 100% relate to how you feel about wanting to do things and be productive but not wanting to deal with people, adulting, and basic responsibilities bc social anxiety/depression makes it that much harder. Now that I am unemployed because of the pandemic my future looks like even more of a giant black hole right now than it ever was before because I lack social skills AND technical skills. This has been my whole struggle since I’ve graduated college because I really don’t have any talent or a “rockstar” personality that will easily get me employed... I could go on but i feel less alone when reading your post and I’m sorry to hear you are going thru some issues with transitioning, lmk if it’s ok to PM you because I literally have no friends either. I’ve completely isolated myself since March so I am def open to being your friend or down to listen if you need someone to vent more <sep> Keyword: walk	0

It can be during a party, a job interview, a walk, a date, etc.nn2- (Much easier to say, but this is necessary) DO IT.nnOf course you know it. It works kinda as a meditation, that decrease your thinking, and also makes you feel much better after.nnHope this helps even a little bit. Scream out loud, open a facebook chat and say hi, go for a walk and say good morning to everyone you see. Shutting yourself at your home is bad. What is the worse that can happen?...NOPE.

ptspks	And I already feel like I missed a lot of fun moments that I could have had in middle school where I didn't have any friends there either. For me it also tends to be easier to walk up to a person in my school when there is 1 person rather than 2,3 or 5 people there. How can I walk up to someone in my school and start a conversation with them/maybe befriend them.. I also have a fear of missing out (FOMO) so as if like I would be missing a lot of fun events and moments if I don't start to make friends now and feel like I haven't enjoyed my life as others from my school which have a lot of friends and this is also a problem cuz a lot of them don't really like me and I fear that they have told them that I am bad or something like that. I am 14 in high school and I have no friends. I find it easier to talk to people on the internet but I can't find everyone's social media account from my school and there are no groups for my school where I could talk to them there online but I really wish there was. I have social anxiety and jealousy over people who have friends. My lack of friends is really putting me down and the only solution I know is to stay home and never go outside to look at people my age. So I really could just wish I could take like a magic pill that would make me stop feeling worried about how other people would perceive me if I walked up to them. So like every time I want to walk up to someone I get this weird feeling in my stomach or somewhere around there and it usually happens when I am anxious about something so that's how I know I have social anxiety and also because I ALWAYS seem to overthink about how to start a conversation before walking to someone and I just think I may annoy them or its not the right time or I don't have enough time to talk to them because in school breaks there is 5-10 minute breaks so I feel like we won't have enough time to introduce myself and it would be akward I also feel like that when I leave the school and want to talk to someone as if its not the right time and place to talk to someone. <sep> Keyword: walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, outside	0

fwbbzu9	"It can also be caused by this my friend. Studies supporting Nofap Feel free to add to this list in the comments. There are countless studies and resources confirming what we know from experience: porn is bad for you. Here's a small sampling of them. • ⁠Clearer thinking / Reduced 'brain fog' - Normalized acetylcholine levels: Pornography viewing has been shown to lower acetylcholine levels, a neurotransmitter vital for cognitive functioning. When cholinergic signaling is reduced, a subjective sense of 'brain fog' results. • ⁠Reduced sexual dysfunction - Dopamine receptor upregulation: The mesolimbic pathway of the central nervous system receives excitatory inputs from dopaminergic neurons throughout various other brain regions. Reduced dopaminergic signaling, resulting from pornography viewing, is thought to be the primary cause of pornography-induced erectile dysfunction. • ⁠^ Same study - shows that porn releases lots of dopamine which we know is an addictive chemical and one we gain a tolerance to quickly causing depletion and withdrawal ( same chemical as cocaine increases ). This tolerance / depletion causes anxiety, depression, lack of motivation and other things listed in the quote below. We know this from specific study’s done on drug addiction and the chemical..... DOPAMINE. On the next study I will provide proof of just how similar porn addiction is to drugs. • ⁠A quote from the study :down_arrow: : • ⁠3.2. Internet Pornography as Supernormal Stimulus • ⁠Arguably, the most important development in the field of problematic sexual behavior is the way in which the Internet is influencing and facilitating compulsive sexual behavior [73]. Unlimited high-definition sexual videos streaming via “tube sites” are now free and widely accessible, 24 h a day via computers, tablets and smartphones, and it has been suggested that Internet pornography constitutes a supernormal stimulus, an exaggerated imitation of something our brains evolved to pursue because of its evolutionary salience [74,75]. Sexually explicit material has been around for a long time, but (1) video pornography is significantly more sexually arousing than other forms of pornography [76,77] or fantasy [78]; (2) novel sexual visuals have been shown to trigger greater arousal, faster ejaculation, and more semen and erection activity compared with familiar material, perhaps because attention to potential novel mates and arousal served reproductive fitness [75,79,80,81,82,83,84]; and (3) the ability to self-select material with ease makes Internet pornography more arousing than pre-selected collections [79]. A pornography user can maintain or heighten sexual arousal by instantly clicking to a novel scene, new video or never encountered genre. A 2015 study assessing Internet pornography’s effects on delay discounting (choosing immediate gratification over delayed rewards of greater value) states, “The constant novelty and primacy of sexual stimuli as particularly strong natural rewards make internet pornography a unique activator of the brain’s reward system. ... It is therefore important to treat pornography as a unique stimulus in reward, impulsivity, and addiction studies” [75] (pp. 1, 10). Novelty registers as salient, enhances reward value, and has lasting effects on motivation, learning and memory [85]. Like sexual motivation and the rewarding properties of sexual interaction, novelty is compelling because it triggers bursts of dopamine in regions of the brain strongly associated with reward and goal-directed behavior [66]. While compulsive Internet pornography users show stronger preference for novel sexual images than healthy controls, their dACC (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) also shows more rapid habituation to images than healthy controls [86], fueling the search for more novel sexual images. As co-author Voon explained about her team’s 2015 study on novelty and habituation in compulsive Internet pornography users, “The seemingly endless supply of novel sexual images available online [can feed an] addiction, making it more and more difficult to escape” [87]. Mesolimbic dopamine activity can also be enhanced by additional properties often associated with Internet pornography use such as, violation of expectations, anticipation of reward, and the act of seeking/surfing (as for Internet pornography) [88,89,90,91,92,93]. Anxiety, which has been shown to increase sexual arousal [89,94], may also accompany Internet pornography use. In short, Internet pornography offers all of these qualities, which register as salient, stimulate dopamine bursts, and enhance sexual arousal. • ⁠Alleviation of depression and anxiety symptoms ( + proof that porn has the same effects on the brain as drug addiction - See quote underneath the study ) - Regulation of multiple neurological pathways: Alterations in the functionality of many brain regions, particularly those related to the dopaminergic system, have been shown to induce hypersexual behaviour. Many of these same brain regions are thought to malfunction in the case of depressive disorders ( and we all know that anxiety is also caused by these same brain regions ). Abstinence from pornography viewing regulates these malfunctioning pathways: The Study: ^ This article discusses porn in several places. In the present review, we will summarize the neurobiological evidence that has accumulated on hypersexuality as well as on sexual arousal in general and excessive pornography consumption in particular. • ⁠A quote from the article :down_arrow: ( shows the correlation between drug addiction and porn addiction) In terms of functional connectiv-ity, we found that participants who consumed more pornography showedless connectivity between the right caudate (where the volume was found to be smaller) and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). DLPFC is not only known to be involved in executive control functions but also known to be involved in cue reactivity to drugs. A specific disruption offunctional connectivity between DLPFC and caudate has likewise been reported in heroin-addicted participants (Wang et al., 2013) which makes the neural correlates of pornography similar to those in drug addiction. • ⁠3 week abstinence period - showed increase of testosterone: • ⁠""Relationship between Sexual Satiety and Brain Androgen Receptors"" Orgasm decreases androgen receptors in the brain. Androgen receptors are needed to use testosterone, with a decreased amount the free testosterone in the body cannot be used and there for goes to waste: *Aswell as increased oestrogen after ejaculating ( this is a female hormone which decreases testosterone even more ): • ⁠""Masturbation is associated with psychopathological and reproduction health conditions"": • ⁠""Sensation-seeking: Dopaminergic modulation and risk for psychopathology"" “…that higher sensation-seekers have both lower D2/D3 receptor density” - This is proven to have a direct affect on social anxiety ( Shown in study’s unrelated to nofap ) : • ⁠Substantial acute increase in prolactin following orgasm ( female hormone which is bad for testosterone): • ⁠Sexual arousal induces hypofrontality, impairing working memory and executive performance. “Pornographic Picture Processing Interferes With Working Memory Performance” • ⁠“The Impact of Sexual Arousal on Sexual Risk-Taking and Decision-Making in Men and Women” Lowers inhibitions and increases risky behavior • ⁠“Sexual Arousal Decreases the Functional Synchronization Between Cortical Areas in Young Men” • ⁠“Brain Structure and Functional Connectivity Associated With Pornography Consumption: The Brain on Porn” “We found a significant negative association between reported pornography hours per week and gray matter volume in the right caudate”, i.e., more porn associated with less gray matter: • ⁠“Craving Responses to Methamphetamine and Sexual Visual Cues in Individuals With Methamphetamine Use Disorder After Long-Term Drug Rehabilitation” “Additionally, our results illustrate […] that sexual demand might be more robust than drug demand[…]” This shows how powerful the effects of libido and pornographic desire really is: <sep> Keyword: surfing"	0

f237ki2	&lt;3 I remembered an analogy I was trying to think of how to explain while typing. A past counselor of mine told me to think of my habits like little rivers trickling through my mind. And so he gave me little things to do each day to get started. At first it felt like the new river would never compare to how deep my old habits were, but the more water I diverted into my new habits, the faster the old ones trickled out into nothing. Each time meant more and more water would be added, making the stream more powerful. Every time I did something, it was like pouring water into the stream. He said I didn’t have to fight it. I didn’t need to be strong enough to build a mighty dam that would stop the rapids, I just needed to divert the water to a new river. I felt kind of weird sitting in this man’s office listening to him talk about brain rivers, but it ended up making a big difference for me. It really helped to think of my new good habits as taking water away from the old ones, bit by bit, and knowing that I didn’t need to suddenly be strong enough to dam off the bad habits as long as I kept working on the good ones. It would start to wash away the riverbank day after day and suddenly one day I’d find myself standing next to a roaring rapids, wondering when it’d gotten so bad. <sep> Keyword: river, stream, stream, river, river, river, river	0

nhqp6i	I am now not afraid of being judged by my skin complexion, IM AFRAID OF BEING JUDGED BECAUSE OF HAVING NO FRIENDS, the bullying really made me an asocial person with social anxiety, that's why I couldn't make any new friends after age 16. I go outside for a evening walk, I see people either talking to someone in person or on phone and I'm just walking alone without doing anything, I feel like every person walking near me, thinks how lonely I am and thinks how weird I would be, I always feel a lump feeling in my throat, when I see people talking to their friends and I just stand there doing nothing. The lockdown is really worsening my social anxiety and depression. <sep> Keyword: outside, walk, walk, walk, walk	3
715z2t	And then Boom I didn't make it. I used to travel all the time with Travel teams during the weekends to go to tournaments. I'm left handed so I would throw with my left but bat with my right. Like for an example I used to love playing baseball I'm pretty sure I started when I was 8 and I usually was the best player on my team. So you can check off that club off the list to join. That embarrassing experience made me quit baseball and bury it along with any other sports I used to play. The whole tryout experience was so awkward I didn't talk to anyone even some to of my friends that were. Up until hs where first year of hs tried out and tbh I was out of shape and I took a year off baseball beforehand.

e3hpk6l	I never got a chance to watch any games because I had to work, so the one day there are multiple good games on tv was the same day as this activity thing. I told my friend I wanted to stay and watch basketball, he said ok. then come weeks later me and these guys make plans to see a movie in theater. I won't deny that I was an annoying kid, loud and obnoxious, and many people didn't like me for it. around January 2017, I had realized that I love drugs, at least I love weed and other natural drugs and not harder ones which I don't want to partake in. but then every time we tried to make plans or do things, they would always fall through and nothing would happen leaving me to myself at home and nothing to do but smoke. didn't hang out with people then either. one of the friends I thought I made had a plan to do something together at some activity with people he worked with. so I never really had that type of experience in middle school, which were probably the most formative years of a child's life. the girls there hated me, the other kids never invited me to hang out outside of school. the plans were made weeks before the movie would come out. then I was given advice and came to another realization that I can't really trust people because they are unreliable and people have so many different intentions and emotions run everything they do. then I went to another private school for high school to play baseball, the first school didn't have a team. then my best friend moved back to Louisiana. then one night a friend from high school that played on the baseball team with me came home for Christmas break and we hung out. we found a dealer and each split a bar of xanax. <sep> Keyword: outside, baseball, baseball, run, basketball	2
isb9v5	Also around people I've grown up with and know really well. I avoid eating in food courts and walking in public because I am scared that people will judge me based on how I walk or eat. I avoid walking down main roads because I'm scared of the people driving past and how they will judge me. I hate leaving my house for walks or even just to take out the trash. I haven't celebrated my birthday with friends and family in five years because I hate being in the centre of attention even though I know its just my close friends. I'm scared my neighbours will judge me somehow or want to start a conversation. I've lost friends because I've convinced myself they hate me and they think I'm weird by distancing myself from them. If I do take out the trash I make sure I can't hear any car driving or anyone talking then I run back inside. My heart beats really fast and I feel like I am going to vomit.

f2xxxh	Apparently I’ve upset my neighbors. But I was able to calm down and realize that they likely weren’t. Early this morning I was outside having my coffee on the porch in my pjs (sweatpants and sweatshirt) as I always do. I’m so confused on what I did. My lawn is like it always is (not beautiful, but not a mess or violating city code) and has been for 5 years. My vehicles are parked in my driveway as they always are. Phil across the street was pulling weeds in his lawn and this lady (don’t know her name) was walking by with the stroller and her dog as she always does. She stopped to speak to Phil, and Phil talks very loudly. She’s always been very kind and friendly to me. Then just now I walk down my driveway to get my mail and bring up my bins and see my neighbor out back, Ms M (who is in her pjs as well).

I'm not even exaggerating, but all of this hurt like help when typing it out, I feel humiliated and I'm cringing at myself, don't know if it's the anxiety but I've never had any social media accounts I forced myself to make this post. I'm overly conscious when I talk or walk cause I've been told lots of times that I walk weird, I haven't been diagnosed yet but I relate to everything thats on r/depression and r/2meirl4meirl except I've never had suicidal tendencies , I've always had panic attacks on the inevitability of death but that's another topic. I've never had friends and I feel mentally exhausted trying to figure out why, I've always been dull and boring, every friendship I've had was of the most shallow, surface level kind, it's been like since as long as I can remember, no one around me either likes me or hates me, I'm always in that grey area where they just don't care about me, I was made fun of and teased in every school I changed, just this dark creature that comes into class and leaves, I'm so boring that I never even bonded with the kids that I spent most of my school life with, I'm abysmal at sports so no one ever wanted me in their teams and I was the only kid that was left out when selecting teams, even in petty playground games, I tried really hard to get better at soccer but I guess I must've some defect cause I never get better at anything I practice: sports, studies and even handwriting, I got scolded for bad handwriting even when I was practice for hours at home, whenever I went out to play soccer, the rest just made me the goalkeeper and all of my evening got wasted just seeing others play, if I didn't go out to play myself no one ever called me, they played by themselves or they only called me cause I had the ball. <sep> Keyword: playground, soccer, soccer, walk, walk	0

I think that is more important for you right now too, rather that focusing on getting friends or getting good are skating, becoming clear minded and focused will do you a heap of good for your self confidence.

It won't happen in a day, it will be a long journey, but you can do it. That's like saying someone with a broken leg is a piece of shit because he walk slower. Try sports, hiking, art, diy, board games, etc.. Go visit places, go to events near you, etc... You are a normal human being, you just live anxiety, which make it way harder for you to become social. You can work on your anxiety and the same way I've seen people with a broken leg walk faster than me, you can also improve yourself and go through your anxiety.

czrbfds	Hey man I felt pretty much the same as you when I was about 16, thinking I needed to have my life put together with a plan and all that. Looking back, I'm 24 and I now see how young I was and that with time, things will change if you are persistent. If you are really worried about weight, try lifting weights or running/skating, something active that you can do regularly and enjoy a little bit. Even walking around the neighborhood for a good half hour is progress and will get your metabolism up. I know how hard it is to cut back on eating, and honestly if you work out consistently for a couple weeks you will start to be able to eat even more food, whatever you want, as long as you keep working out because it will burn off. Especially how fast your metabolism can get going when you are still young. I was cheated on when I was 16 and I know the ending of a relationship feels like the end of your love life forever when you are your age. Time heals wounds, just don't try to rush the pain away. I didn't get my license until I was 17, and I thought that was really old, but I know people that didn't start driving until they were even 18-19. I know it sucks not being able to drive, but I'm sure you will be able to afford driver's ed in a reasonable amount of time if you save for it. Do you have any retail or grocery stores near your house that you could walk/take the bus/carpool to? If so, you can get a part time job that you could save up for driver's ed. That will also get you out the house, and get you interacting with people, which sounds scary to people with SA, but after a week or so on the job I think you will come to appreciate it. Anyways, if you have any questions about anything, you can PM me and I'll try to answer ASAP. Good luck, and don't give up. Conscientiousness is a good trait when you learn to put it to good use, and it's something a lot of people lack. I hope you can learn to embrace who you are and gradually live a life that you are proud of. Take care. <sep> Keyword: running, skating, walk, walk	2

g40bpn3	I let everything out at the moment and afterwards I felt much better. It started off for me very rough, I felt the same way you did and every day was torture to go through.

nd524m	After a few work socials I opened up that I was quite shy and prone to panic attacks and she always made sure to check on how I was doing. As some background I also have abit of a stutter which can make me prone to panic attacks if it flares up particularly badly. Fast forward a few months and one Friday night during after work drinks I said that I was so fed up with being socially anxious and I just really wanted to step out of my comfort zone and Sarah suggested (this was after a pint or two!) I'm quite a big football fan and Sarah's boyfriend runs a 5-a side team on Tuesday nights so she made sure that I got involved and I got on well with her boyfriend and the team. Sarah said she wanted to show that everyone gets embarrassed from time to time, but that things will be ok and that there is always something more embarrassing that could happen! When we were in the wax museum, Sarah could see that I was getting anxious/embarrassed and so (making sure the coast was clear) Sarah decided show her knickers and pose as the 'Class vs Ass' Breakfast at Tiffanys revamp and just with the shock of it, I burst out laughing and felt my anxiety disappear. <sep> Keyword: runs, coast	0

There was this girl that I've known since 5th grade from my OC days and she thought I was really funny and stuff and I moved in 7th grade and basically lost contact until the end of freshman year and we talk a lot on FaceTime and Snapchat and she said that she was coming up to Sacramento, where I just moved, to play me in a tennis match and a couple days ago, she asked me if I was interested in going to the Winter Formal with her at her school which had me confused because she's an athletic, good-looking girl who easily could've gone with someone else. <sep> Keyword: tennis, tennis	2

But the main culprit for me not going is, you guessed it, people.

I wish it was as easy to swim completely alone as it is to go for a walk completely alone. I'd hate to be 2 or ugh more in one lane. Maybe I'm hyping it up too much in my head though, probably am.

osqpy1	(The center of this park is just grass, and around it in an oval shape is the path). 30 minutes in my dad had to throw out some trash, the nearest trash can was on the other side of this field. He lets me know he’s going to go throw something out and told me to keep practicing. I don’t remember what they said exactly but it must’ve messed me up pretty badly because when my dad got back I told him I wanted to go home because I was “tired”. I haven’t been on a bike since, I want to learn but just the thought makes me feel nauseous. I’m 16 and can’t ride a bike. I’ve never told them why so they probably just think I’m lazy or a shut in. My parents, brother, cousins, and aunt keep trying to get me to learn but I always refuse. So my dad decided to teach me with training wheels. This happened about 5 years ago and only lasted a few short seconds, so why does it still affect me so much that I can’t even get on a bike? We were at my neighborhood park and it was going pretty well, my dad was explaining the basics while I was getting used to the bike.

I absolutely despised myself because of this flaw to the point I lost a shit on ton of weight thinking it would get rid of it which it didnt. I was anxious the first time. To get over this you have to learn to see the difference between having deficiencies and being deficient, failing and being a failure, doing something stupid and being stupid. When you're outside you believe people are going to see your flaws and inevitably hate you because of them, and that'll just confirm the hypothesis that you have about yourself.

f6p96cs	"And you can too. Bringing the trash outside, a matter of seconds that often took me hours of mental preparation because I just couldn't manage to open the door and step outside. Buying food, I always bought as much as I could carry and then ate it as slowly as possible in order to stretch it for as long as possible. I don't know how feasible that is in your situation, but one part of how I got better was that I started running late at night/early in the morning when nobody was around. I stopped attending classes, and I didn't leave my apartment except for buying food and to bring the trash outside. If you don't feel like jogging, just taking a walk every night probably works just as well (though I feel like the physical exertion helped by distracting me from my fears). Like I forced myself to go jogging at some point between 2 and 6 a.m. every day. Not great for my sleep schedule obviously, but at least it took away my fear of the outdoors little by little, and the exercise helped a lot as well.

By ""like this"" I mean depressed, lonely, and having a whole bunch of social anxiety. I always find myself scrolling Instagram looking at couples my age on the beach or at a club smiling and having a good time. I had friends but the man reason for that can be attributed to me being good at basketball. I had it all growing up. I would constantly avoid talking to people in school and when I did have a conversation and I would always try to plot my escape out of it. I would spend more than half the day at my local gym working on getting better that I neglected being social and talking to girls. Meanwhile i'm in my room completely alone and feeling like my life sucks because i'm not as happy as them.

eyndycp	If you want a job that wont be too intimidating but will still improve your social skills then i recommend working at some type of activity venue. But if you just work at like the front desk or shoe/skate hire, depending where it is your working, its a really great way to get used to serving customers without having an overwhelming amount of tasks to handle and not having to say too much. Example: I work at an ice rink in skate hire, theres only 3 things people can buy (rent) and the communication between me and the customer is very minimal. That may sound like a horrible idea, i definitely though so at first. This was my first job and i was terrified but holyyy shit since ive started it my social anxiety has improved tremendously, and i can now confidently approach customers and make small talk, as well as with my coworkers. like a swimming pool, bowling, ice rink, escape room, etc. <sep> Keyword: swim, pool, skate, skate	0
4hkju5	And every single time I don't approach someone to strike up a conversation, that immediate feeling of regret sets in, yet I can never do anything to correct it; it's like my mind leaves my body and I just watch the opportunities go by like streetsigns, hardly able to be read in the darkness. Every time I see someone I want to talk to, I feel like it would be better off if I just said nothing to them because someone like me couldn't possible make their day better. For most of my life, until five months ago, I was a serious video game addict. I quit every sport I played by middle school and suffered a skateboarding accident that forced me to quit skating in middle school, along with the possibility of starting martial arts; something I craved to learn for years. I've never been particularly socially isolated, but as highschool has gone by, I've become more quiet, reserved, and distant from all of my friends, driving them away in fear of being too clingy to the couple that I have left. When I walk next to people in the hall or outside school in the morning, I imagine what I would say to them, but just can't actually make the words come out because I'm fucking horrified of them thinking I'm weird and ugly and starting rumors about me that would just make me feel worse. <sep> Keyword: skate, skating, walk, outside	3

aiqlhu	First day of community college. Like most people, I had my first day of college ever. The last time I was in an official school was May of 2015, when I graduated high school. So, it’s been awhile. I was trying to find my classes and I wasn’t nervous. The first class was cancelled. I went to my second class and as soon as I entered the room, the teacher said she’s cancelling the class. So, I sat down in this commons area until 10:40am for my next class at 11am. There was only a few people who were there, so, it wasn’t bad. I get in the next class at 10:40am. Only 3 people are in the room. But, slowly, more people started entering the room. I was getting a little more nervous. Twenty minutes later, the last student came in and the teacher was right behind them. She introduced herself then said the dreaded “Tell me about yourself” and told us to ask her a question for her to answer. My mind was racing trying to find something to say. When it was my turn, I said “I know how to ride a RipStik, which is like a two-wheeled skateboard.” As soon as I said that, I heard someone, behind me, mock me. I wish I could have said something in that moment but the teacher was still talking as the person mocked me. I didn’t even get to ask her a question. By the end of class, I was thinking I should say something to him, but, then I hesitated because I didn’t know if it was that person or a different person, so, I just let it go. I just stared at the guy, who, *I thought*, mocked me for about 3 seconds while simultaneously putting on my stuff. Then, I drove home. <sep> Keyword: skate	0

7iwhkt	I've started to see how this lack of socialization that started at a young age (moving almost every year until I was closer to 10 years old) has limited me and my relationships all my life, I've literally had no idea why people would want to talk because I'd never had conversations beyond how was school and what should we have for dinner and did you walk the dogs already. It's not really a conscious choice I make, it's just what's ingrained in my nature by now because there never was an alternative. It's still hard for me to grasp the ways in which other people think and what they're like - I've always been keenly aware it's not the same way I am, I'm that observant at least, but past that it's been a total guessing game and I was never very good at it. Looking back, my friends were all next-door kids and classmates who I'd hang out with because it was convenient and because there would be too much fuss all around if an adult (usually a teacher) thought I didn't have friends. No one wanted to hang out with me after school as soon as I was too old to be hanging out with someone just because they live right next door, and since early teenage I've gotten used to always being alone and doing everything on my own. Now I'm wondering if this indeed is the case and I simply didn't get the chance to develop these skills, or if it's totally normal to not have talked about proper topics with anyone and not having had friends outside of school and I'm just looking for excuses for my own shortcomings again. This in turn probably made people just weirded out enough by me to not want to be close friends, although most would still treat me very nicely so I thought this is probably how things are supposed to be. This still hinders my ability to make and keep friends because it never occurs to me that they might want to do things together that really don't require more than one person (Because, you know, it turns out people just like to be in each others' company. Today it seems easier to distance myself from this realization enough to post about it. <sep> Keyword: walk, outside, nature	2

I just got a new bike and I want to ride it everyday but everytime I even think about doing it at that moment (just going when I want) I get anxious because I feel very awkward just cycling around the neighborhood alone, without a clear purpose. I usually can do it just fine if I'm going with a friend but right now that isn't an option. I want to go outside but I'm anxious. Shit like that that helps me feel better that I don't go outside.

Going places with somebody else can help you feel safe in the situation but expose you a little more to the outside world. If there is it might be helpful to open up to them about how you’re feeling so they can support you a little more. Is there anyone in your life you’re comfortable spending time around ? It just starts with the smallest of steps. It’s okay to struggle to go outside. Just remember that it’s okay to feel the way you do.

dwxycgw	"People can be nasty because they are really insecure and are flailing for anything easy to make themselves feel better. One time on the train there were these two handsome gay men clearly in a relationship. I was on my way to a concert with my girlfriends. I was a junior in high school and desperately insecure of my body. All of my friends looked amazing in their crop tops and tiny shorts, and before leaving I spent like two hours panicking over what to wear. Nothing looked good on me, and I couldn't pull off going out clothes like my tiny friends. I was tall and curvier (not fat, but not small). Finally I threw on black leggings, a white tank top and a black leather motorcycle jacket. It wasn't my favorite outfit, but I felt relatively OK and just wanted to get to the concert. So finally feeling somewhat comfortable on the train, I notice the two gay men are looking at me. I was trying to smile at them (because this was around the time I was coming out as bisexual and felt unity with anyone queer....something I've learned with hindsight isn't really a thing unfortunately, at least not really). Then one of the men says something like ""I didn't realize Shamu was going to be making an appearance on the train today,"" while looking disgustedly at me. At the time, I had no idea what ""Shamu"" was, but just based on the way he made the comment, I knew it was something mean about me. That alone put me in a sad, frustrated mood for the concert and I wasn't much fun, but eventually I got over the mean tone of the comment. Then the next day I was telling my friend the story, saying I didn't know what ""Shamu"" was, but it didn't sound good. He told me to Google it. It was the killer whale that lived at Sea World. The random man that I was trying to smile at on the train said I looked like an orca, pretty much to my face. I was 17 and so insecure of my body, even though my BMI was fine. That still hurts and I'm 22 now. Now whenever I see — or briefly consider wearing — outfits with a black jacket and black pants with a white top, I cringe. Like I said, people can be nasty.

qokalt	"At the time my dad went to her house and offered to pay her but she said it was totally fine, but tonight after complaining about our fire she said ""And ye' break my window and dont say anything about it"" (Like I said, At the time my dad literally went to her house and offered her money, but she declined). But it all ended when we all went in the house to use the bathroom. I remember just a few months ago when he mowed the back lawn, she and him would have long conversations. I was the last one to use it, while my dad and my brother went back outside. Now, its one thing to complain about someones bonfire on their OWN property but then she out of the blue started attacking us for our religion. She even gave us bags of goodies for our mom. She said that she ratted on us to the fire department and they said they would talk to us and my dad said they never did. She then brang up the time my little bro smashed her garage window with a baseball by accident. She told my dad ""You say that your a man of God yet your having bonfires that could kill people"" (Like, bruh, how is having an innocent little bon fire a sin? She was yelling at him about the fire, saying how ""it was right next to her garage and she has gasoline in there"", and other stuff like ""that could catch fire on trees and kill people."" So we have this old woman neighbor who was always super nice to us when she saw us and our dad in our back yard. Whats even funnier is that she was cussing as she said that. When I got done and went back outside, I saw the neighbor lady in a pink night robe talking to my dad. <sep> Keyword: lawn, cookout, outside, outside, trees, bonfire, bonfire, baseball"	0

But the second I'd walk up there I could feel my legs shaking. Even on vacation on a remote beach, I was scared to unwrap the towel from myself and get into the ocean because there were families in the nearby distance who could see me. Even the ones at my college for people with anxiety. I do try to stop myself when I notice it. I know, this sounds dramatic. I picked them all throughout school and college, and still do if I'm outside and other humans can see me. I was always the worst one there and always felt judged like I was a freak of nature or crazy because of the difficulties I have communicating. My heart racing. No one but my current boyfriend (who is one of the two friends that I can communicate with decently well) has seen my bare legs in years.

As for the stress of the work itself, I think if you just keep on keeping on and doing your work consistently you'll eventually increase your pace and achieve more in a shorter space of time, keep at it, it might just take a little while to get up to a speed where the stress of the work will reduce a bit, what is the job? I quit and became long term unemployed, really not a good place to be. I think if you can find a productive way to use all the anxious energy, a sort of positive distraction like going for a run or going to the gym or swimming or something, whatever you're into, straight after work each day. Maybe invite some of your colleagues / coworkers that you want to get to know a bit better to do some sort of activity that you enjoy outside of work like if you like going paintballing or to the driving range or bowling or bouldering or something it could maybe help you bond with them. Maybe that will lesson the amount of time your spending thinking about everything.

As soon as you feel ready, step outside and do something, like take a long walk: Find a destination, go there and back again.

57gsvd	I'm feeling like I don't have interests or a personality. But I realized that I was doing the activity only because with it I could overcome my anxiety a bit, but I wasn't enjoying it! For example, 2 months ago I started horse riding because I thought it would be good for my social anxiety. I thought I had interests in certain activities (for example horse riding, or baking) but when I did the activity, I wasn't enthusiast. I'm not a person with so many interests, but the interests I have, after a while I'm not enjoying them anymore. <sep> Keyword: horse, riding, horse, riding	2

dgky0y6	By the way I walked in the gym today with new shoes for my squats and was afraid of people judging me for my shoes throughout my whole workout. I used to be the worst runner in the school running team, I consistently finished last but I was still improving, shaving off seconds each week. Instead of sugarcoating my weaknesses, I had to face them. It didn't matter if they were stronger, or everyone had finished before me, I had to see improvement, because that beats false self-satisfaction for achieving the same record repetitively. Not to mention that progress takes time and effort, so patience and consistency is key (consistently trying very hard to aim for results in the long run). Progress will come, you can want it badly and stare in the mirror everyday, but you won't see it until some time passes, and you get fully surprised.

I started off with customers and now I’m getting smooth with the people around my workplace and today GUYS please BELIEVE me , I sat next to the pretty girl in my class and talked to her with ease and didn’t get anxious at all ..not even for a second ... I was reading a lot of posts to boost my confidence and I realized it’s not just me actually there are lot of people who are in the same boat ... AND AND I was just reading and doing nothing ... So, here is my story.. I’m 25 and super anxious ... and I started using reddit recently ... So, while I was going through some post ... one of them pointed out that it’s worthless if you are just reading and not making any progress ... GOD this hit me so bad... Yes yes ... it was little awkward and nervous on the day 1... but on day3 it went down so smooth .. Guys trust me ..it’s just the initiative you have to take.. it is similar to the 1st day of learning the bicycle ...it’s scary and you are afraid of getting hurt ... but eventually you don’t even care if you get hurt ... you just fucking step up and continue riding it...which means I had some bad interactions too ..but I didn’t let me down.. <sep> Keyword: boat, bicycle, riding	0

4u08d7	Anyways so I feel like I developed social anxiety in 7th grade because I don't want to sound stuck up or anything lol, but I would usually dress better than my friends and they would always find something to make fun of about my outfit, so I've downgraded my clothing in 11th grade to t shirts, basketball shorts, and vans. Does anyone have any tips to get over this and if you've gotten completely over it, could you guide me? My social anxiety has ruined moderately ruined my social life because whenever someone saints something to me, I always get really nervous and either stutter or don't say anything at all and just nervously smile. Then after that they would make fun of the shape of my head or how big my feet are, and eventually I became so self conscious about my appearance that I would just bottle up in class and say almost nothing. This is my first Reddit post because I just wanted to vent and rant somewhere and this is the first place that I've thought of. Whenever I walk into a classroom I feel like everyone automatically is badly judging me and I just get anxious the entire time in my seat,, wanting to talk to people but to nervous of rejection or failure. <sep> Keyword: basketball, walk	0

Because of my father's work, we moved a lot both within the US and outside the US.

6hhke7	I now know that my embarrassment to take my shirt off at the beach or at pools from the age of like 12 came from this. I now know that my inability to make strong eye contact when talking with people comes from this. I saw myself as being judged based on my physical characteristics and being bullied/made fun of for that. I'm not depressed, I'm not suicidal, I don't hate the way I look in the mirror most days, and I'm certainly not anti-social, but my lack of self-confidence is so ingrained into me that it pops up in ways that aren't as simple as thinking I'm unattractive in the mirror. It's the reason why I am so preoccupied with a desire for sex (even when I physically don't want it), because in my mind, if someone is sexually interested in me, they desire me, and all I've wanted is to be desired physically and receive that approval. It's the reason why anytime a woman actually has interest in me, I lose feelings and run away. <sep> Keyword: beach, pool, run	2

4nm6g3	Social Anxiety at the beach. Also I'm sorry I come off as like a spoiled brat for saying how I'm not enjoying a vacation at a beach when I'm blessed that I'm able to come here every year. Also my friends will be getting here a day later then I am so it will improve a lot when they get here but I just don't think the beach is too enjoyable when you have SA. Even one of the best parts should be at least seeing a bunch of girls in bikinis but even then in the back of my head it's just like what does that matter you can't talk to them, never done anything with a girl, so that part is kind of depressing I guess. I've been going to this same beach for my whole life 19 years and we go with a huge group of family friends and other ppls friends and it's almost a 100 ppl this year, and meeting all these ppl again when I only see them once a year just is triggering my anxiety which for the most part is pretty manageable. So I'm at the beach in Florida for the week and this is the first year that I've realized I have social anxiety and it makes the beach less enjoyable.

fnq1yo3	"My social anxiety is more directed towards coworkers. So it's important to kinda consider what you are willing to work with and arent. My therapist had told me about considering a job where I can control when I do or dont want to talk. A job that allows you to practice when you want or can. Theres even degree ideas for people with social anxiety like computer programmers cause they're jobs that require minimal talking. For me, I enjoy doing Uber Eats where I'm from cause talking is minimal (especially with this pandemic going on, most people want you to just leave it at their door). All I have to do is tell a worker at whatever restaurant "" I'm here for doordash for *insert doordash name*"" ""thank you"" and leave it at their door. If I do see the person all I say is ""have a good one"" and quickly get to my car (people really just care that their food is dropped off so they're really not judging like that). Next order! No need to talk to coworkers, I'm not worrying that I'm being judged. Just delivery and listening to music I genuinely enjoy. Sign up for delivery, be a dog Walker. Work at a library. I also work at the irs (tenprorarily) I like it there because they even have a policy in orientation to not judge people: to basically not judge and we all have our strengths and weakness, thus are equal. So far nobody has judged me like people do in more extroverted areas like restaurants (I recommened avoiding restaurants unless you feel it's something you can take on). At that job I'm also able to hang myself and not worry and I can talk to anyone and people are open. Some are mean but some people are gonna be mean. We just gotta learn how to handle it and that's ok too to make mistakes. My coworker actually told me about how two girls made fun of her hair: Mean chicks: *snickering* ""hey your hair a weave?"" My coworker: "" Nah this is natural. Why? Yours isnt?"" Inside I'm like ""OOH BURNN, TELL THEM GIRLFRIEN"" Outside I dont show emotion cause I feel I express stuff awkwardly sometimes. working on it though. I know its tough dude but I know you can make a badass comeback :oncoming_fist: doesnt matter how worthless you think you are or what others make out of you. You can totally be a better and stronger you and there is people who understand us and will accept us for us. For me, a person who has social anxiety and has been depressed, has been talked about my coworkers and managers about being odd or something (or a loner or pushover) I've show my true colors to my fiance who had honestly made me feel most loved, even during times when I might've not been focused on him at all. During my ugly times we've pushed through the dark times and sometimes some people have to be their own hero. Cause even with my fiance I still have to do my part in loving myself. I also have a friend who's experiences SAD and shes accepted me despite not having ti hang out a lot. I met her at my old job. We were both quiet and she just so happened to have SAD too. Not everyone who is quiet is that way though. One dude was just naturally quiet but laid back and happy and mixed more with the coworkers that didnt like me. What's important is you out yourself first and make time to be a happier you. You're gonna fail. Yohre gonna take a step back after making progress sometimes. You're gonna cry.

Before the day I cured it, I had difficulty expressing myself, communicating with ANYONE, going anywhere where I was in risk to having to speak with someone or seen by anyone, small things like cutting the grass, doing my jobs, going to the store, and even seeing my own family at get togethers I would not be able to speak to them.n Some things that held me back from being myself because of the SA include: meeting new people, being terrified to interact with others-especially girls, skipping school because I had a presentation that day, not being able to my perform to my best abilities at any of my sports games, quitting my travel soccer team because one of my coaches made us do random things like dance or say something goofy in front of the team and I wasn't cool with that at the time, instead of hanging out with friends I would rather just hide and play video games or watch anime, I couldn't even talk to my first ever girlfriend in 7th grade (I have no idea why she liked me. I don't know if meeting her was a crazy coincidence or another sign from God because we share many things in common. I just had to meet her right away because I almost had the feeling she was my soul mate or something lol. I never gave up on life though because I always believed and prayed to God that I would find that happy life that everyone else seemed to have while I was just sitting alone at that lunch table trying to figure out why I am so different from everyone else. Instead of going to see a doctor like a normal person without SA would, I solved my own problem with the use of the internet. Keep in mind she did not know my true self-only my SA self), and the list goes on.

mtkd0s	"Unsure about boundaries with my horse's new owner. &amp;#x200B; Can anyone please help me, I'm afraid to ask the girl to come see the horses, I'm afraid of taking too much space and insisting too much. &amp;#x200B; I feel really really terrible and sad and negative right now, and I know it's partly why I'm so afraid to interact with the girl. All my happiness and support was dependant on this barn and this horse. Also it's their home, not an open riding center, I kinda feel intrusive. Both of the ponies are quite old but still in great shape, so most of the days they chill in a field of grass, but the girl and one of her friend go on rides occasionally. But it's not my horse anymore, and I want the girls to make the most of their new friends. But my mental health has really gone to shit since. But, sadly, the riding center had to close down a couple weeks ago. During 7 years I took care of a lovely pony in my riding center, the owner trusted me with him and let me take care of him as if he were my own. Having your own horsie at home is the dream of every horse girl ! Hi, sorry if this does not belong here. I don't have my safe place (the barn) anymore, I don't have my family (the people who had horses there and the people who worked there) anymore, I dont' have my emotional support anymore, I don't have my personal horse-time anymore. I don't want to be that awkward older girl coming around all the time to spend time with a pony. I feel awful, I lost all the progress I had made in my head. I have to ask the girl by message when I can come, and we usually go walk the horses together, which is really a big obstacle for me... I miss him, and I want to be alone with him. I think it's a great situation for both the girls and the ponies, I really do. I used to go to the barn whenever I wanted, no matter if someone was there or not. I was and still am not able to afford a horse of my own. I went to see the horses twice in the last few weeks, and I was supposed to go again last week but it fell through. I'm craving to have some contact with my horse so much. I'm over my sadness, now I just feel happy that my dear friend has a perfect life with girls who adore him, and I'm happy for the girls. It really was the last thing that helped me stay upright, and now I don't have it anymore. Sorry if some phrases don't make sense, sorry for the mess I am. That was a really hard thing to accept because it really was the only place where I felt safe and like I belonged. The girl and her family have told me that I can come see the ponies when I want to, but honestly ""when I want to"" would be every day. The thing is, the owner had to find new homes for his ponies, and ""my"" pony and his best friend were adopted by a lovely girl (around 13 I think) and her family who owns a farm. We formed a great bond, and during all these years he was my emotional support. When I start to feel low, I know it's time to go to the barn.

Most of the university students that are going are going to be younger i assume (or more so fear). I’m 24, and they’re more like around 20. Ofc there may be older students but I feel like it’ll be more so around that younger age range. That’s making me nervous and feel like a lame and idk if I should force myself to go.

Even just taking the trash out is nerve wracking sometimes. Go to the store and buy ingredients. I second the work out. I still prefer to stay indoors, but stepping outside for anything has gotten much easier. Just focus on the task at hand and do it and come back. Want to go for a walk, find a destination and walk there and back. Well at least I do. When I don't have a regular routine I feel like shit and become very self concious when stepping outside my apartment. nnAlso, I noticed that not having contact with other people sort of amplifies the anxiety because you sort of lose touch with the outside world and become more paranoid. <sep> Keyword: outside, outside, outside, walk, walk	1

dftfzgb	rejection therapy, -i personally find asking for instructions/directions easier or ordering something, especially when i'm in the city -talking over the phone or voice chat is also easier -talking to older friendly people less intimidating -sometimes on the subway people would be openly talking to each other so i would put some words in and they would be receptive -having a chat with the food vendor -nodding to other runners -talking about video games as that is a more comfortable topic for me with people my age and gender basically in more professional situations like service where communication is more moderated, directions where getting help doesn't involve yourself as a person as much, having something established (like video games or running like other runners) to a channel to communicate through another dynamic to consider, since i find girls more intimidating to talk with, i just ask them questions, like with a pretty retail worker with older people, i find them less intimidating, so i don't use instructions as much a crutch but have a short conversation with them, like the weather, or whatever they be talking about on the subway like news here are videos and a channel on rejection therapy, some of the stuff he does is more drastic, so you gotta remember to start tiny and climb very tiny steps, don't flood! like in my case asking out a girl immediately would be flooding, especially if i try to ask out multiple people. <sep> Keyword: runners, running, runners, climb	0

oj9vb3	Can't even walk to the store anymore... INFO: I have general anxiety, so it's constant. I'm desperate at this point. I'm meeting up with therapists (tried like 8 at this point I believe), trying to chat with people online, challenging myself daily to like go outside and sit on the porch, trying to do the opposite of my anxiety. It can work at times, like some days I'll feel kinda good and be able to walk to the store or smth with modest anxiety, but then I'll afterwards fall into this pit where I can't even walk out of the house to sit on my porch without having a panic attack almost. It's always heavier breathing, my heart can rapid beat out of the blue sometimes, but social anxiety is a huge part of my general anxiety. This doesn't work, none of them do.

In reality, you and how you feel about yourself is all that matters.

mvei5w	"Standing up straight and looking at people. Today I felt pretty anxious in the morning. When I left the house I just did not feel right. I am a pretty anxious guy, but today I just felt twice as weak and pathetic as usual. My chest also felt really tight and I had trouble breathing. After about 15 minutes of walking I realised that I was completely hunched over. First I pushed my stomach and my chest out and I felt a big difference. Then I decided to ""make myself taller"" if you know what I mean. I could breathe again and felt pretty good. I have the problem that I become self conciouss pretty easily and walking like that made it even worse. So I decided to look and people and cars and look really long at them. I kind of made a rule that I look exactly at what I don't feel like looking at. It worked great. I have tried some things out recently how to do better in public. Today I had the most success yet. It felt great. I am worried that it is obvious that I actively think about walking straight, but at the same time I know that it is the right thing to do. You can't really blame someone trying to become a man. So yeah, I am now gonna practise standing up straight while looking at people everyday and see how I feel in a month.

Everything was fun until I did a Saturday shift, and it was hell on earth, just order after order endlessly, pushing and squeezing to get around 12 other coworkers in a tight space, stuff just going missing and customers loosing patience (Unlike during the week where there are rushes and slow periods, you could give your customer your individual attention and work quickly yes but also in a sense with love). I think I was just already overwhelmed and the comment was just the straw that broke the camels back. I would start trying to find little odd tasks here and there to avoid the line even for just a few seconds, stuff that needed to be done (taking out trash, fixing up the display, replenishing stock that was running low) but were not a priority so I understand why I got called out for it. So a coworker (see that just makes it even more pathetic that I’m upset over something and I don’t even know who it was could of been a manager or just a regular team member) with her stinging valley girl voice said “can you please stop worrying about the bagels and just help the line”. <sep> Keyword: running, bay	0

Ever since then, I just knew she was the one. I (16M) want to talk to a love interest (16F, classmate) more, but I worry that I annoy her. Now, I'm just waiting, and I don't want to initiate a conversation, I want her to do it, so I know she at least likes me as a friend.

9a3tja	&amp;#x200B; # Falling off The Golf Cart At the very end of May I was hanging out with the guy who was my best friend at the time. &amp;#x200B; # Senior Year Like I said at the top of this post I start my senior year on Monday. A lot of my other friends kind of stopped talking to me too since I had to tell them I couldn't hang out since I couldn't walk easily for like 3-4 weeks after falling off the golf cart and I think they thought it was just an excuse. Even though it's been almost 3 months my leg is still pretty fucked up looking but it doesn't hurt that much anymore. From what I can remember me and maybe one or two other friends would occasionally do pills together if we felt like it but it was nowhere near as often as it had been before. I asked him if I could drive it since I had never driven one before and he let me. I could barely walk about 6 hours after it happened and I decided I had to tell my parents two days later when it wasn't getting better. I hid it from my parents because I was scared of getting in trouble or being accused of being on something when it happened. We were just hanging out in his neighborhood and at the pool and driving around on his golf cart. When I told them I lied and said my friend was driving when it happened and they believed me and after I was a little better and could walk a little bit more they wouldn't let me hang out with the friend it happened with because they blame him for it which is pretty much why he's no longer my best friend and we just don't talk anymore. <sep> Keyword: Golf, pool, golf, walk, walk, walk, golf	2

5lay8l	"Another year wasted due to SA.... I have't done anything for myself this year.I remember that last December i went to a store and got some gym equipment because i wanted to start working out and improving myself,so i can somewhat raise my self-esteem,which is almost 0.That equipment has been sitting untouched and unused for a year now. Academically i do well,but bad at self improvement.I would have rather had the other way around and be happier with myself. On last year's new eve i made a wish to get a gf,but i was wrong;i realized that i cannot meet a girl until i am truly satisfied with myself and raise my confidence.If i don't like myself how can someone else do so? The wish for this year will be to become better and hopefully i will finally start working out(not specifically to find a partner,for myself),but i find it very hard to get the motivation and get to action because i have an unhealthy habit to feel inferior to people that are in better shape than me and think ""i'm never going to reach that point"" because i feel stupid when i start something new,especially if i'm alone in a room with multiple people that are much better than me because of their experience. I used to do swimming when i was a kid and i was good at it.The biggest mistake was quitting because high school admission exams were coming and i have lost the drive.As an effect of quitting swimming i gained some weight, i have developed SA due to some crappy experiences with people, and lost all my self esteem on the way.From that point on my life went down spiral. I feel stuck in a ditch and i can't seem to be able to make myself get out of it.I wish i could extend my foot and give myself a hard kick in the ass to start being productive again,but unfortunately i cannot physically do that,but mentally,which is the hardest part. It's like there is a fight in my head:while my rationale tells me to sign up to a gym,my emotional side keeps me from doing it.. If anybody could give me some advice or motivation,i would strongly appreciate it :) Anyway,happy new year to all of you and hopefully 2017 will bring something better to us! <sep> Keyword: swim, swim"	1
fy49bpa	As you might imagine, that was a very stressful time for me. But after about 6 months, I started to really get anxious again, and it started to become where every day was a struggle, mostly just due to social interactions. I worked the first month or so without pay, but I eventually proved that I was a capable enough pro and started to get paid. Only my job experience wasn’t in retail like yours, I was a tennis pro at a tennis club. So, when I was around 20, I decided to take time off from school, and find a job.

Today I was in the park for my daily run and this guy who looked older than me by like 7 years or so I’m (15 btw), and I was warming up to run he was jogging past me and was like come let’s jog together at first I had my headphone on and just wanted to run my daily 5k, but then I started to jog next to him and we was asking each other questions he asked me how long I’ve been running for and other stuff. <sep> Keyword: park, run, run, jogging, jog, run, jog, running, run, run	2

After nearly a decade of trying, I don't think so. Fuck Therapy, it's all just a money-grabbing scheme, lining the pockets of Starbucks-drinking soccer moms and BMW-driving professionals, probably going through a mid-life crisis themselves. I mean, why not.. it's Saturday night, and I'm lonely as hell.. right..? Paid $11 for a beer, but it wasn't all that bad cause I got a free coke, and the security were happy to put my backpack away.

e5v6ia	As I look back on different situations in my life where I got anxious, nervous, and/or got this ‘numb-type feeling’ that overtook my body and my surroundings felt off, it was typically while skating, playing hockey, driving in a vehicle, being around a large crowd of people like in a sports arena, or anxiousness led to it and it took a little while to relax and for the sensation to go away. Body went completely numb, surroundings felt weird, it felt weird to move my body. Even though I loved skating and hockey more than anything, I basically had to be forced to go back and start skating again, as I was too afraid that it would happen again. For all my life, I’ve felt wobbling and rocking sensations (like I’m on a boat) even while sitting still. I did get back into skating and hockey, and several years later, when I was probably around 16, I was in a hockey tournament and it happened once again but this time it was while playing on the rink. I rushed off the rink super fast as I felt nervous and it took me several minutes of sitting down in a seat and relaxing until it went away. I was told that as a baby, when I was bouncing in a chair or being rocked back and forth, I would cry - so that was stopped quickly. It was all confusing for me too, as I simply did not understand what was happening or why it was happening again. Later on into childhood, I was doing a lot of skating at hockey rinks and playing hockey. Moving my arms and body just didn’t feel normal. Now today, I’m in my mid-20’s, and about a year and a half ago, I started taking a protein bar out with me while in public because there were certain points where I figured my blood sugar maybe just dipped a bit low (felt a tiny bit nervous), I would eat the snack and felt better a few minutes later. Now, I’m dealing anxiety and difficultly leaving the house (a bit agoraphobic) since having 2 panic attacks in public. Putting myself in motion then coming to a stop can magnify that sensation. There was one time, when I was around maybe 10-12 years old, I was skating around the rink and all of a sudden got this super numb feeling from head to toe, almost a light-headed feeling, where everything around me felt ‘off’. This feeling I got while playing hockey or skating ultimately led me to quitting the sport I love. This ‘off-feeling’ still happens here and there (not nearly as prominent as before), but mixed with the current state of anxiousness and difficulty being able to leave the house. <sep> Keyword: boat, skating, skating, skating, skating, skating, skating, skating	2

p1lzvd	School started yesterday, already dying from exhaustion. So yesterday monday the 9th school started for me. I couldn't even fall asleep, same thing today. It is so exhausting to try and stay calm, try and concentrate when really you can't cause your mind is just out of controll. I ought to tell my new main teacher that I could suffer a panicattack in class, actually I should tell this to all my new teachers but I can't muster the courage to do so. This morning it happened again. I don't know why but sometimes when I wake up I cannot move my legs so I just stay in bed regretting everything and having anxietyattacks before I can even get up. Today I would also have sports class or PE whatever you want to call it. Notice from the teacher implies that we would go swimming. I haven't been to PE for a year and I cannot start going again. Really swimming (starts to tremble just from tought). So yes school is hell as ever but I'm in the last year so I hope I can manage by sneaking into the library and SSRI, which is giving me killer headache atm.

6bw852	As time went by, I noticed that what I was pretending to be, was no longer pretending, my body and mind got used to the new body language, the new line of thoughts, the new confidence and the new ME! I pretended to be something I'm not, confident, if I spoke to one of my co-workers I made sure that on the outside I look confident, head up, shoulders up, eye contact till hes the first one to look away, even though I feel like im almost dying on the inside, on the outside I looked confident. So what I did here was basically to pretend! When I reached home, I would just greet everyone with a very assertive good morning, even if it felt really really awkward, again, what on the outside mattered to me. as time passed, I started to build confidence, because I simply don't care what others have to say anymore, I started fooling around in public, singing loudly in my helmet while riding my bike because I don't give a *** what the dude in the car next to me thinks, even if that makes him laugh, so friggin what? his problem, I couldn't care less, my life, I decide what I want to do with it. my life, I enjoy doing that, not gonna see him again in my life anyway. <sep> Keyword: riding, bike, outside, outside, outside	0

I’ve also been trying to apply for some entry-level fashion logistics jobs (I feel like there’s less human interaction and more physical doing) but they rejected me per usual bcuz of my lack of experience since dog walking is my only on the books job I’ve had so far :downcast_face_with_sweat:. I know I want to work with dogs/pet care business as the main goal somewhere down the line bcuz it’s truly my only real passion and I know for damn sure I am not going to sit in an office all day with gossipy co-workers as my social anxiety/introversion just won’t stand for it lol. I swear I’d rather pick up dog shit for a living than ‘collaborate with others’ that’s how bad I am with people and teamwork I know this is a suggestion you maybe weren’t hoping for or takes a lot of drive n patience but I realize people like us who struggle with SA and are introverts should invest in ways to work for ourselves that way we don’t have to report to a superior or worry about a toxic, people-oriented work environment.

So to tell you something about my situation, obviously I'm not the type of person that goes out really often, besides school, going to my piano lessons once a week and playing table tennis twice a week which I probably wouldn't do either if a friend of mine who goes to the same table tennis club didn't go there aynymore. <sep> Keyword: tennis, tennis, running, running	2

6hmoh1	Feeling depressed and weird. Soo... I am a boy who is 17 years old. I am just gonna get to the point. I am feeling depressed for over 2 months now. The main reason is because I overthink and that I think that no one likes me. I have a close friendgroup but most of them are just like me gamers and don't go to party's that often. I really like to party and a copple of my friends join me in that but 1 of them knows so many people from the whole region that he just doesn't look back at me when we are at party's. It's hard to describe the whole situation but I'm going to try. I have 2 veryyy close friends in the group where I meet up with. One of them is like I said very popular with all the other 'cool skaterboys popular kids' and the other one is very fun but also when we're at a party they just go to other friends and don't look at me. It just feels like I'm their friend just because they have no one else. I also have struggle to talk to people. I'm a very joyfull and happy person and most people like me when they know me well but I am scared of making new friends. I trust no one from my age because I got bullied when i was 10 years old. Now I overthink everyday that people will bully me again or will attack me for no reason. All the people of my age that I see or know through my other friends are just also kinda like those skaterboytypes. I am not like that at all. Sometimes they just say like fuck it we are going to the big city in our region and I don't like doing things like that. Everything for me has to be planned in advance. They are so different than me and I'm trying to make other friends but I am so scared of everybody and I can't keep a conversation going for more than 10 min. I asked one of my friends to introduce me to his friends from another city and we were going to do that next week. Now he cancelled it because 'He doesn't want to mix his 2 friendgroups' basicly saying that I won't blend in. I feel like i don't blend in with any group I like being with popular and fun kids but then I'm quiet but when I am with my friends Who are maybe losers but I feel comfterble their because i am more popular than they.

cqxzbb	Success! I have been able to stay at parties and other social events!. In the summer there are many religious parties in Portugal because it is a very catholic country. In thesr parties filarmonics are hired to play music and I belong to one so as it us expected during these times, is that I have to play in many villages. Well, every year we play in a certain village far way from our home town, in Guarda. We get there by late afternoon and we eat a snack, play on a procession, eat dinner and then go to the party. The party is basically a stage with a musical group singing and dancing with a wide open space in between for people to dance and nearby you have a bar and such... Last year I had a panic attack during one of these, it was awful. So many people around me made me not wanting to dance with the band members that were all doing it and then I stood out and bam, got overly nervous. This year was different, I brought valium from home just in case but I didnt need to use it. Me and my friends were having a great time, drank a few beers, danced and even talked to some gals, we are around 16 and 17 years of age btw. I was astonished, I made it, I didnt even get nervous.

8v2xrk	For curiosity's same after my brothers friend called my ugly at a holiday to a city , I made a tinder account to see if he was correct, and unfortunately he was correct and I deleted the app. However, I am immensely afraid of leaving leaving university, as it is my only means of potential social interaction with girls. I also don't drink alcohol at all never go out with friends (never been drink) and essentially have no friends other than people i check my engineering subjects work withTaking this into account I am fairly certain after uni I would have lost all chances of meeting a girl. I know when I start working as a civil engineer I will be unable to socialize outside of work as I am terribly afraid of going out (bad experience at nightclub when previously mentioned brothers friend and some others essentially made me go to a nightclub, I just sat down on a stool for 3 hours feeling pathetic and useless than I ever have).

fp34dgp	It sounds like you're just not ready to socialize outside with friends. As for not beating yourself up over what happened that's tough and I don't really have a good answer. Break it down into easier, more manageable tasks. Focus on improving and on comparing yourself to who you were yesterday and not to who someone else is today. If you are consistent and slowly take on harder and harder challenges you'll probably eventually be ready to hang out outside with friends. If you work on yourself in the way I've described you at least have something to feel good about and feel proud about. Try not to compare yourself to others and beat yourself up over the fact that you can't go outside whereas other people can with no problem. Whatever it is for you that is challenging but manageable, do that. You may not be ready to socialize with friends outside, but maybe sitting on your front porch reading a book is anxiety-provoking but manageable or maybe going for a walk is anxiety-provoking but manageable. <sep> Keyword: outside, outside, walk, outside, outside	1

nbv1e8	Anyway like I sprint up the pitch and then I always loose the ball and it’s just so embarrassing. I don’t mean to but like I just start running and it’s really fast, I’m not purposely sprinting like it just happens idk. I know it sounds dramatic but I just hate embarrassing myself or the thought that people might be thinking I’m trying to show off by running fast when I don’t mean to do it. I messed up I took a shot and it went way wide. Idk I was running up and just hit it with my bad foot which sometimes works for me but I fucked up. In one match I ran up the pitch and I heard some girl say like jeez she’s quick or something but she said it in a jokey way as in like why tf is she running so fast for no reason and I was so embarrassed. I’m just ranting idk why this is keeping me up I just feel so embarrassed. I’m just really overthinking this match and I can’t sleep. Like I wasn’t trying to show off idk like I just start running and it’s fast paced but I’m not purposely doing it. Like I wreck myself speeding up the pitch and fuck up and it happens all the time. Like one time in training we were doing a drill in pairs and the other girl was like can we take it slow (we had to do the drill 10 times) and I said yea but I just started and I went fast. The main thing I’m embarrassed about it like I always end up sprinting up the pitch. <sep> Keyword: running, running, running, running, running	2

jvge2e	After some discussion (partly to help a friend in need and to carry out my resolution to step out of my comfort zone) I agreed that I would volunteer to take the model's place and pose for Alan's exhibition. As I had been on Furlough for the past few months (now back at work!) Every year our village hosts a photography and art exhibition to promote local artists in the area and also raise money for local charities. I became good friends with one of the members of the group, Alan, who is a retired photographer and artist and as he is now in his mid 70's he enjoys keeping fit and socialising with the walking group. I had been looking through old photos and files and thought that I would share my personal experience of stepping way out of my comfort zone and overcoming a mountain of anxiety that I have experienced for most of my life. To set some background, approximately 5 years ago I joined a local walking group within our village who meet up every Sunday to go for a long walk (with a nice pub stop at the end!). Two years ago, during our pub stop after our walk on a Sunday, Alan was discussing that he had been planning on entering the art show that year but that a model that he had hired for his exhibition - *Sexuality in the Media vs Everyday Life* had cancelled at the last minute and that he was feeling quite down about this (art is a great escape and freedom for Alan after the death of his son a few years ago). <sep> Keyword: mountain, walk, walk, walk, walk	1

I also worry that I'm fucking up my 20s (I was 19 IIRC when I finished my exams, I'm 21 now, becoming 22 in a few months) since they're pretty much *the* time in your life, and I've already pretty much lost the first two. It feels like I'm going to be like this for all eternity at this point and I'm really slowly losing hope. It's like a pretty vicious cycle, since the derealization and social anxiety (and one other thing) keeps me from going outside, getting a job (never had one), etc, and staying indoors all day and doing nothing but browsing reddit and stuff like that amplifies the derealization and social anxiety. Since I finished my exams I haven't had any friends, barely go outside (typically I spend a lot of weeks inside before going outside and that's just a really short walk with my father usually) and I think social anxiety is the main culprit here. So, long story short, early 2019 I finished my exams, I've been home since then just doing things I like, had a panic attack in August somewhere that year and have had derealization since which makes me feel surreal 24/7 and more anxious than ever. <sep> Keyword: outside, outside, walk, outside	2

pv15om	Having FOMO with social anxiety = constant dilemmas of whether to go to an event or make an excuse. Also i have a singing performance in a group for which i need to go at 4pm. But having to say “i cant go” last minute makes me feel bad and worried of being judged and disliked. Idk if it’s worth going to the beach party, esp because I’m worried I won’t have fun plus I’m already kinda worried abt my performance that same day. So tomorrow theres this big beach event/party for my uni which involves activities like surfing, kayaking, and volleyball which is super intimidating to me tbh (but super cool to most ppl). The beach thingy ends at 1pm. Theres gonna be like a 1000 ppl there. <sep> Keyword: beach, surfing, kayak, beach, beach	2

td75ad	I have two friends and both from school, for a long time I did not make new acquaintances. I'm going to track progress in a daily habit format. addicted to video games, smoking, porn. at first glance, this habit may seem stupid and ridiculously easy, but it has several functions: to start at least some beginning of my recovery, to accustom the brain to perform the same action regularly, which will benefit my discipline and bring at least some order in my life. but I want to focus on the good and also would like to believe.. if u're still reading and didn't get super bored, let me know it's okay to post stuff like this time after time. rarely go outside, and also work from home. right now I'm finishing this post and going for a walk. so at first it would be a good idea to start going out and moving around a little, so the first habit would be to walk at least 2000 steps every day. when regular walks become habitual for me and I can follow this habit without any volitional effort, I will begin to develop the following obviously, there is a lot of shit in my life and a regular walk will not fix it. <sep> Keyword: outside, walk, walk, walk, walk	1

(sorry for the english but it's not my first language) - don't stare at the ground when you walk, keep your head high - smile and look happy when you're around people I hope this will help you, as I said I'm doing great so far (even though today I still chickened out when I wanted to talk to my crush) but I feel that slowly I'll get better! - when you have a social interaction of any kind DO NOT think about it after, not 10 minutes later, not before you go to sleep (you'll come up with things that you think looked or sounded awkward) unless you need to do so for a specific reason. I'm sure that when you see someone you think about something to say even if it is superficial, but then you approach him/her or vice versa and everything is gone. Well from now on try to think about the thing you want to say as if you're jumping off a trampoline into a huge pool, it looks scary but is the safest thing ever. <sep> Keyword: pool, walk	0

3sqrtr	I got the courage to join a Basketball team... Hi! Before I tell my story, I'd like to say that my biggest problem with my social anxiety is having interesting conversations. How can I reach out and meet my team and get comfortable around them? I managed to tell my parents to get me a hoop and a ball so I could play in my free time. I play often! I really do love the sport, and when I heard about the Rec league basketball sign ups, I couldn't resist. I was excited to play for a team, but I was nervous I would be outdone by people who are far better than I am. I'm a 16 year old male.

My point is that most people don't really care about that, there isn't a rule. I've always loved walking but being really anxious about other people, i stayed indoor.

4wn8db	Also, if I’m in a situation where people will notice how frequent I pee (for example a car ride, where we have to *physically stop the vehicle* so that *I* can pee), I will have to pee extra frequently because I will be embarrassed at people knowing how frequent at pee. At a party where people are wandering all over the place, are drunk and there is loud music, it’s alright, because then I can pee frequently and people won’t notice (plus if it’s a possibility, I can pee outside in the woods/somewhere more hidden from peoples view). I hate my job. I hated not wearing a t-shirt. I honestly believed that happening was very realistic (I was also scared that she’d just make fun of my nipples). I would always decline invited to the beach, even though I really wanted to go. People would stare, some even chuckle and laugh, and I felt like such shit whenever someone did. She would pretend she was interested in me, I would open up to her and tell her how I feel, and she would then laugh, run around and tell everybody what a fucking idiot I am, and they would all laugh at me.

pn8gd6	(Socially anxious) you feel fearful in almost all situations. (There are two types of generalized social anxiety (I do not know if it is written here) that is that he is afraid in everything that has to do with socialization ... it can be asking for food ... just being surrounded by people, walking outside where there are houses or cars etc! A person with specific social anxiety is not afraid in all situations, but most are, but there may be some who feel perfectly fine, for example they may just feel nervous talking face to face with someone, but not walking outside. Basically social anxiety is twice as much if not worse than being shy. <sep> Keyword: walk, outside, walk, outside	3

d57r8lv	I'm going to try doing that this week. As for other people, I haven't gone out yet. I bought The Hitchhiker's Guide Trilogy (5 books) last week and decided I would take a 15 min (-ish) bike ride to go to the tip of a park (a huge stretch that is surrounded by water) and I would read my books there. I haven't taken my bike out for a ride in at least 2 years. I just haven't gotten around to do it yet since it rained and it was cold all week last week and during the whole weekend. Installed it on her phone, and we might be going to hangout together outside too. She enjoyed it. Then Pokemon Go came out (-ish, got the APK since I'm in Canada and its not officially released here) and it just gave me another incentive to leave my home. <sep> Keyword: bike, park, bike, outside	2
gzsrki	Everybody is usually there with a friend and I’ve never seen anyone there by themselves. I don’t have any friends where my dad lives so inviting someone over isnt an option. I feel like I would look weird and people would judge me. I felt really awkward. It’s currently 96 outside. I’m 14. I’m at my dads house this week - My dads house has a small neighborhood community pool that you need a key fob to get into. I’m really tall, really pale at the moment, my swim suit is bright orange/pink and my hair is a faded purple color. Last time I was at the pool people (middle-high school aged) stared and were whispering and moving away from me and some parents were staring at me. Most people that go to that pool are elementary - middle school aged kids, with their parents or groups of high schoolers. Now with covid we are supposed to social distance in the pool but idk if anyone is doing that. Will I look weird going to a pool by myself?. <sep> Keyword: pool, pool, outside, pool, pool, swim, pool	2

It's not that I don't ever go outside but I usually only go when someone invites me. My second thought is - where will I go? People can be really hostile towards those who park somewhere they aren't supposed to. So one of the first anxious thoughts is - where will I park? There are Facebook groups dedicated to vandalizing badly parked cars. There are no museums, no theaters, cinemas are closed or only play movies at 10pm. There is no other reason to walk around town for me. Where do I even want to go? Which is like once a month. <sep> Keyword: outside, outside, outside, park, park, park, walk, park, outside"	3

dm4khog	Exposing yourself to social situations is like being expected to jump into the middle of the ocean when you're afraid of swimming. If the other person has no concept of social anxiety or they don't realise that that's what you're suffering from they draw all kinds of other conclusions about you from your behaviour and treat you accordingly. It's not easy to find a way of doing so at your own pace. The 'I just want to run' is so typical of that feeling when you feel trapped by a social situation. When people are scared of swimming, they ease into it gently, tip-toe into the water and then the next day they can go a little further. <sep> Keyword: swim, ocean, swim, run	0

I would say, push yourself outside your comfort zone, but don't pressure yourself too much or be hard on yourself. It took a long time for me to have these realizations.

n3ot8t	"Possible social anxiety?. I am not looking to be diagnosed by a complete stranger but I just want an opinion by someone with SAD because I've been really confused. First of all, not only do I get anxious talking to people I don't know well but I often feel anxious around my friends. Anytime my two closest friends ask to facetime I get so so anxious that sometimes I try to find any excuse to get out of calling them (which I always feel bad for) and then when I do facetime with them I get all sweaty and shaky. And it's the same situation for when my friends ask to hangout in person. I think the main reason is beacuse I hate those awkward pauses in a conversation and I feel like most times I have no idea what to talk about. Secondly, my self esteem isn't great. I often catch myself comparing myself to others. It's espscially when I'm at school and it feels like people are staring at me. I'm always worried about how I look and how I act. And if none of my friends are in my class I can't make converstaion with other people which is the worst especially when I have to do group work or group presentations. Like I said before my self esteem is bad which means that I always put myself down. For exemple, if I answer a question wrong in class I say ""I hate myself"" or ""I'm so dumb"" repeatedly in my head. And I find that I dig my nails in my palms in these kind of situation where I'm anxious. No, not even close to point where they bleed like Betty from Riverdale. It's just slightly but still I thought it was important to mention. Lastly, lately I've been feeling really unmotivated and useless. Which is most likely not related to what I think is my social anxiety. I don't have the motivation to exercise, to do homework, to make food, basically anything. And I know it's not healthy physically and mentally and I even feel guilty about doing nothing all day but I just have no motivation to do anything about it. I'm even scared to post this... I feel like even if this is a social anxiety subreddit that maybe people are going to judge me for digging my nails in my palm or for not even wanting to hangout with my closest friends. I don't expect anyone to reply and if you don't want to that's totally fine but if you do thank you so much &lt;3 <sep> Keyword: River"	0

Now, its one thing to complain about someones bonfire on their OWN property but then she out of the blue started attacking us for our religion. She even gave us bags of goodies for our mom. She said that she ratted on us to the fire department and they said they would talk to us and my dad said they never did. She then brang up the time my little bro smashed her garage window with a baseball by accident. She told my dad ""You say that your a man of God yet your having bonfires that could kill people"" (Like, bruh, how is having an innocent little bon fire a sin? She was yelling at him about the fire, saying how ""it was right next to her garage and she has gasoline in there"", and other stuff like ""that could catch fire on trees and kill people."" So we have this old woman neighbor who was always super nice to us when she saw us and our dad in our back yard. Whats even funnier is that she was cussing as she said that. When I got done and went back outside, I saw the neighbor lady in a pink night robe talking to my dad. <sep> Keyword: lawn, cookout, outside, outside, trees, bonfire, bonfire, baseball"	0

I wish there were private bodies of water I could go to where there's nobody, but I live in a metropolitan city... if I could go with someone I trust, I'd do it, I do have friends but most are busy or I couldn't ask them something like that. It is my worst nightmare to be half nude in front of hundreds of strangers, I wouldn't even be able to enjoy the water. It's not just going to the pool, just anything really, like going to see a movie, a play, public activities, grand openings, etc. So we currently have a heatwave that will last about a week here, and what do people usually do? <sep> Keyword: beach, pool, pool, beach, pool	3

dg9us97	"Wow your story is actually very similar to mine, I discovered the severity of my social anxiety when I went to a ""open air"" rave, I don't know how to say it in english, basically a festival in an open area, it was actually very beautiful, the setting was in the middle of a couple of very beautiful mountains, the stage lined perfectly to the sunset and the music was very powerful.. But in a way I miss it, everything was so beautiful, the music, the mountains, nature. But then it started getting crowded, waaaay to crowded for confort (close to 20.000 people in a small area), also I had taken a hit of LSD beforehand, because I had already used it before and felt great and I felt empowered to change things I thought I would feel the same in a social situation. I loved the way it throws my brain into this hyper state of mindfulness and wonder, but I didn't realize it could also throw you into a downward spiral, feeding your fears even faster and making them feel extremelly real, that day I honestly thought I was going to turn crazy...

pdxsut	Debating on whether or not I should do basketball. And trust me, the anxiety was bad, on days I’d have b-ball practice I’d just sit in school and think about not wanting to go to practice because of the anxiety, and not even wanting to play in games because of the anxiety. But when I’m in my backyard playing, it’s just completely different, I feel comfortable, not afraid to make mistakes and I’m just acting like myself. Even though, deep down I loved playing the game, I always felt like I couldn’t play as good as I could have possibly have, compared to how I play really good when I’m just by myself, playing in my backyard. Haven’t played competitive basketball since I was in 7th grade. I’ve always loved basketball but the thing that made me stop doing it was because I’d always get so much anxiety playing. I’ve always thought, like man, how good would it be if I could play competitive basketball and not let this anxiety control my headspace and effect the way I play…. My fears were always about getting yelled at by coaches and teammates, and of players bigger and better than me, and I always let that get the best of me. So high school basketball tryouts are coming soon, and even though I’m afraid of feeling like how I did in the past, when I played basketball competitively, I feel like in the future I’ll regret not playing basketball for my school in high school because I let the anxiety control me and prevent me from doing what I wanted to do. So yeah just wanted to post this to see about anyone’s thoughts. <sep> Keyword: basketball, basketball, basketball, backyard, backyard, basketball, basketball, basketball, basketball	3

6b466z	"I admit I never had the courage to walk up to a girl at the bar and start a chat, always felt like i'm really ugly, but as time passed I've started to build my confidence, and the fact that I had girls flirting with me also gave me a confidence boost aswell, as for today I have no problems whatsoever having a conversation with girls I know such as from my work, friends of friends, etc, I guess it only happens while i'm alone with her, outside of where we usually meet like work. I am 22 years old and it all started since I got released from the army half a year ago. I thought it was just bad luck, since I was really hungover from yesterday's night drinking. I thought once again, bad luck, maybe something I ate or I don't know, just bad luck. a month has elapsed and my friend invited me to go with up and sit with 2 of his female friends at the bar, so I agreed and we went with our bikes to their house to pick them up, on our way there I just to stop like 5 times to pee, we picked them up and went to the bar, after sitting at the bar for like 10 minutes my brain just went into ""down"" mode, started feeling locked and then felt like im about to throw up, so I told them I'll be right back and went to the bathroom, and as far as I've gained distance from our table my nausea has reliefed and I didnt have to throw up and more so I decided to go back to the table, went there and sat for like 5 minutes, having good time, laughing, and then all of a sudden my brain does it again, and once again, out of the blue my stomache is going insane and I just had to literally run to the bathroom because I couldn't hold it for much long, it was really urgent. and this point I realized something is off, and third time bad luck is too much, and I've started to realize that maybe its anxiety and my body is going into fight or flight state because its pretty much it's symptoms (nausea and having to go to the bathroom feeling). my first encounter was a few months ago, where I've gained some confidence and sent a message to a girl on Instagram telling her lets go for a trip (she loves motorcycles which I own), she said alright and I went to her and picked her up and took her to some place something like a motorcyclists meet up spot, and out of nowhere in a matter of seconds my stomache just completely lost it and I REALLY needed to go, it was so urgent I lied to her that my mom was involved in a car accident and I'll be back in half an hour and I just left her there and drove as fast as I could to my house, and ran up to the toilet, the weird thing is half way to my home I almost couldn't hold it anymore, and when I finally got home I didn't really have to go that bad but I did, after I went I felt so much relief and went back to her, we continued to a bar and once again out of the blue my stomache completely lost it and im lucky the bar had a toilet and I just ran there as fast as I could as I almost couldn't hold it anymore, after going in I felt a relief for the rest of the day. on the first night we went out to the bar from some heavy drinking, and after I got drunk I've noticed im finally out of fight or flight state, feeling absolutley free and I've had the time of my life, laughing, dancing, just really enjoying everything, I thought its finally over but the next morning after the alcohol effect were gone I were back in that state. so I spent the entire weekend in fight or flight state, I barely ate anything the entire weekend, nausea and having to go the bathroom just came and went all the time, I went to the bathroom like 30 - 40 times during the past few days even if there was little to none to let out, but when that feeling came, I just had to run to the bathroom and felt nausea and my brain just locks up. <sep> Keyword: walk, outside, bikes, run, run"	2

I'm just fed up in general lol. Turns out I don't find it any easier nowadays though lol I been debating if I should even bother trying at this point in time. if anyone has any advice other than stuff like ""just speak to people"" that will be great (because for some reason everyone thinks that will fix it even though half the problem is the fact that I have no where to meet anyone bc I don't go to school and I'm not allowed to just wander around outside nor do I want to). my mum and nan think it's because of my dad (he was not very nice and he left us but nothing too bad) but I really don't think it is because I rarely think of him which they say its because I'm doing it subconsciously but I just feel like they just have a hard time understanding that most likely nothing caused it I just am this way for some reason lol. <sep> Keyword: outside, outside"	2

fbxhrqi	I understand what you mean! But on the other hand - I, for example, am really bad at replying to messages and staying in touch with people, so I can see how people around me could think I don't wanna spend time of them because of that, when it's actually just my anxiety. And people get busy and distracted too, and have their own things to think about.nnIf you really enjoy spending time with someone, and they enjoy it too, they would have no reason to reject your invitation, unless they are genuinely busy, but then you could always reschedule. Taking the first step is scary, but then when they actually accept, you go out together and you enjoy the time you spent together, it will be worth it. nnAs Winnie The Pooh said:nnºYou can't stay in your corner of the Forest waiting for others to come to you.

i8nlw8	Honestly the only times I'm truly comfortable are when I go outside in my city and walk through the crowds without talking to anyone, like in shopping centres or metro stations or markets where I can sort of just exist and blend into a crowd without being perceived by people. I work from home too, my job was in a small office but remote working came in back in March due to Covid-19 and we have stayed this way since, I'm going into the second year of my postgraduate degree in just over a month's time and that's also going to be mostly remote, all of which allows me to isolate myself even more than I would normally. It's truly a sad way of living, I wish I was comfortable enough to be able to go into shops and cafés and talk to people and order things like a normal person but I just... can't get over my fear of being perceived and evaluated. <sep> Keyword: outside, walk	3

hwgkq6	And I never answer it . Dude I won’t even go outside in case the neighbors might see me or ask me for something (they use to ask my dad for rides all the time) .

I can’t even leave my house for more than 30 minutes and it’s been almost a year. I live at the end of a street so if I drive I have to pass the houses all the way down to the end of the street. I see a psychiatrist and he put me on meds Wellbutrin +latuda+klonopin . If someone is coming over I told my dad to let me know so I lock the door so I have enough time to run to my room and hide for hours and hours until they leave .

Also, I don't seem to understand how to make physical contact with another guy in terms of jokes without looking gay (e.g. Another thing that pisses me off is in basketball I hesitate to grab the ball from other people because I don't want to invade their personal space, but in floor-ball (hockey with no ice), I have no problem almost bashing someone's stick out of their hand.

g4un9n0	I was selectively mute, and very hard of hearing when I was younger. The only friends I had were the people that adults forced onto me. Though the friends I did have were very supportive. Through the help of counsellors, I came out of my ‘shell’, and I can now talk to people, have conversations, be sociable etc, it just gives me a lot of social anxiety. When I was 10, the ‘popular kids’ in my class started being extraordinarily mean. One of them would give me Chinese Burns under the table every day, until I stabbed him with my pencil. They’d completely ignore me, then tell me I should be used to it by now. They’d call me a monster and make games about how terrible I was. Then they’d spread lies about me, saying I was a hypocrite, and turned basically the whole class against me. I worked out that over the course of only 2 days, 2/3’s of the class had said something derogatory to me related to one particular lie, and of the remaining 10 people who hadn’t, only 2 actually supported me. Towards the end, they started to corner me behind the edge of the building, break my hearing aid, throw me against the wall. It was honestly the worst time of my life. I couldn’t tell anyone either, because I knew that teachers were useless, and my parents believed in standing up for yourself. Which I did, but what are you supposed to do when it’s 10 on 1? Nobody helped me. I got really depressed. It was never diagnosed because I never really told anyone. I just acted happy when my parents were around. But I remember getting home, and sitting in the corner of the bathroom, holding the radio right next to my ears and tuning it to between stations so it just played white noise really loudly, and then just rocking back and forth while moaning for about an hour. That was the o my way I could calm myself down. It’s been 4 years since it began. I’m in secondary school now, and I managed to get into a school that they didn’t, so I don’t see them anymore. Well. To be honest, one of them goes to school with one of my oldest friends who I go swimming with. My old bully began feeding my friend lies and basically ruining my time at club too. But I clarified what actually happened, what that person is actually like, and it’s all good now. Even after all this time, I still don’t talk about it. Nobody knows except my sister, my best friend and the kid from swimming. It’s left a massive impact on me, as I’m constantly worried about the same thing happening again. My social anxiety came back in full swing after it, but it’s better now. I’ve learnt some tips, like, be confident. To be honest, I was bullied so much, I honestly don’t care anymore. Also, some of the popular kids at my new school tried something on me, as I was obviously the quiet nerd. I just went completely postal on them the first time, and now nobody tries to bully me. I’ve also made it my mission to help those who are being bullied themselves. I know how horrible it is, and I never want anybody to go through any of the pain I went got. I’m so sorry that you had to go through this too. I wish you, and everyone else all the best. Have a great day. :) <sep> Keyword: swim, swim	0

Honestly, if you playing soccer and you are dieing and gasping for breath, you aren’t going to be thinking about social anxiety :face_with_tears_of_joy: I never really made any friends in basketball, and would often get picked on for being awkward, but I was always pretty comfortable playing sports with other people (because I grew up doing it). I tried really hard and did my best, but I didn’t make the team. In junior high I was the best player on my schools basketball team, and I played basketball for my high school in 9th and 10th grade. Just go have fun. My mom new I was very shy and a doctor told my mom they she thought I might have a very mild form of Aspergers (which I probably do). My senior year I tried out for the soccer team (I had been practicing by myself for about a year and 2 of my friends were on the team). Sports don’t require a lot of social skills, plus you will meet people who share your interest (soccer).
