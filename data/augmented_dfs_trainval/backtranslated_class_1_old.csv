Backpacker I've been telling this to a few people around here applicable in almost all posts I think I know what you mean this sounds obvious but try to get their anxiety a little under control one of my ways is meditating sounds weird I know but actually help not after once but after half a year I really started to see a difference starting tomorrow or tonight half an hour every day you'll learn to control your mind I also walked away from my group of friends for a while I threw myself in the deep backpacker across another country there's no one to judge then even a weekend away could help you feel free to send a message or answer if you have questions be careful,1
"walking, nature doing the same as now taking a good walk in remote nature or going to detect metal if I didn't have sa i could possibly have a friend or partner go with me that would be so big in fact to go on a trip with someone is a fantasy of mine",1
"Out, walk yes totally my neighbors don't like it because sometimes I smoke out near the apartment I know I shouldn't but anyway they just look at me I feel insecure about it and tend to look away so once I woke up and went out for a walk I was sober that rarely I am and made me feel more confident looked my neighbor in the eyes as I passed ahead of him and I was quite relaxed greeted me instead of ignoring me id say it really makes a difference to me",1
"Run, park im feel like you feel that way im and ive had social anxiety and bpd since I was around I feel like I got completely lost in uni and now I have a full-time job where I can't wait to run home and be alone it makes me very sad and every time I push myself out with people I end up getting depressed yesterday I pushed myself to go to a house party away from home and ended up in the smoking social zone my friend is always super safe and noisy sometimes to a very annoying degree I in the other hand just sat on a noded corner and clumsily smoked my cigarette I ended up crying to sleep because I felt so pathetic I told myself today it was a big step for me today I challenge myself to go to a park with a friend I haven't seen in a while and chat just keep giving you little consistent challenges you're not alone",1
walking no need to go to the gym that makes me nervous walking your dog will work long walks calm me too,1
"running wow exactly like me the same age, but macho im was also bullied in school and literally nobody calls me, but even so it's so bad to find music you like to watch series that you want and read books that you want without any feedback from others when you're alone like me around times in a week I'm going to run to release some pressure makes me anxious to run beyond people so my mind just pushes me even faster to escape them I just came to a solution if I can't connect with people that I need to fill that loneliness if I'm not going to get depressed so at least one way to make my well-being a little better I also can't stand social websites like instagram or facebook because of the photo stuff and fake people so I just deleted my accounts don't even have any profile choices on whatsapp just make you feel a little bit better a step at a good time luck",1
Fresh air is fine sometimes the social anxiety is like the last party in the office I went to that it was hard for me to eat and talk so I totally understood I went out to get air I went back and still felt a little strange but the fresh air totally helped if it still feels super uncomfortable just tell them that it doesn't feel good and going home there will be other parties and sometimes if your too much anxiety is good to take a break,1
Walking I think I've overwhelmed my therapist but here the good news is sure to say that social anxiety is just one of my many problems when I told my therapist about my isolation from anger and the history of drug abuse I saw a look in his face as oh shit this guy is seriously in need of some help Theres a positive side to this although I guess to meet him again in two weeks in November my goal is to face a fear every day for two weeks until my next session I started today walking around campus and meeting a stranger who also told me how alone they weren't anything important happened but I started the conversation and broke through the first stage of anxiety I didn't waste any time making the first move today in force for these next two weeks so I can go back to my therapist with news of improvement if you're reading this I know it's hard like hell there when the fear of not facing your fears weighs more than the fear itself than when you find the motivation to change,1
"Walking will pass and get better as always not with social anxiety, but our brains will probably have to relearn some things again too I felt this a little bit a few days too when I was getting some ice cream I felt like the shopkeepers were looking at me maybe there was but their off never in a malicious way as we thought it was but this is something that is a basic task and something live moved past a while ago so I had defto gone a little bit back but their ups and downs always so im trying to keep positive at least going out for a walk every day is allowed and their good for your mind and everyone is out of walking atm as it is the only freedom we get during isolation so if you keep doing that sometimes you have to come through people and at least make eye contact and say hello to them to make it easier and keep things tied up until we get back to normal",1
runner im a runner and I have to say that you're wrong after running I feel fucking great it doesn't completely cure my social anxiety but I definitely feel euphoric and elevated,1
"I was really uncomfortable with him hard with that for years it made me little attractive and other things but I was more afraid to work in a gym and people seeing how fat it was and how I wouldn't do the exercises at that moment im live with him so I didn't do anything then during my last year of school because of the lack of any social life and things I decided I had to do at least something meaningful in my life play programming games and watch physics minutes all day I didn't serve any more time then I started to run every day in the afternoon though the fields where no one could see and bother me more I think I started with km very slower and I only hated much more running and it was very bad in him but at least at the end of the day I had the feeling that id had the more time, I had the more time and time I had the more time and time I had the more time and more time and I had the more time and more time and I had the more time and more I had the more I had the more time and more I had the more time and more I had the more I had the more time and more I had the more time and I had the more I had the more time and I had the more I had the more I had the more time and I had the more I had the more time and I had the more I had the time and I had the time I had the time and I had the time",1

outside don't be afraid to get up and get out if it's not your thing I personally hate to play the same mediocre music without much variation people are drunk and annoying way of self conscious dancing and letting go with friends is sometimes tolerable but then they can pressure you to start dancing and stuff and then I get ultra defensive and close or you can go out and have a breath to cool off if you need to,1
"I don't care how I act and then everything goes wrong but my anxiety amplifies everything that goes wrong and then I keep thinking about it and what's worse to take a walk is a great way to start in a residential place with fewer people and then I move to place with more and more going to cinema cinemas fastfood restaurants conventions also helped me to all the situations in which I had a little bit of anxiety but that lets me see how people act and let me understand a little bit better than one thing you have to do is stop being negative about yourself doesn't seem so negative although you say that anyone who does not bother to read this that looks like your negative reading your thread doesn't bother us we're there to read these threads like any other but it's important that you don't do it much more than you do it, but what most does it is much more, but what's not so much more, and what's more and what's not more, and what's more we don't bother us about is much more than we're not wrong these negatives much more, but what much much more, but what's much more than much more than much more than losing something, but what much, but what's much more, but what's much more, but what's much more and what's much more than, but what's much more than, what's much more and what's much more and what's more and what's more, what's much more than, what's more and what's much more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, and doesn's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more than, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more than, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more,",1
"Out you have to put yourself out there your easiest saying that fact trusts me I know join a club go to the gym go out more I personally wouldn't try dating online but it's an option to find someone with similar interests there are millions of women in the world thousands that are completely compatible with you im extremely uncomfortable myself but I have found that life is much more rewarding when I challenge myself to become proud even if the first woman you fall in love with rejects should still be proud of yourself ist life always peaches and rainbows and there will be times when your efforts seem to be in vain, but staying strong you don't get to pick up yourself there you deserve love there's someone out there that deserves you so much as you deserve you were brave to publish this that it's some kind of right progress you're making great progress",1
Nature has been doing it very gradually over the past few years yoga and meditation really helps by opening up space in the body and consciously breathing allows more space for different thoughts to enter into your mind also has been doing longer distance running in nature without music just focusing on my breathing and mind has taught me a lot about myself has also been consciously using weed and psychedelic mushrooms to open up more too but id really recommend getting in a good head space through yoga and meditation in order to be more receptive to what the plant can teach me find that as with all that it is important not to stop enjoying plant medicines and allow your body to find its sober balance helps you to get lessons sinked into more following my feelings and focusing more on my own ive interests started to feel more comfortable in my own skin and I have been going to events for myself something that was unimaginable a few years ago and to meet with so many other related pretty people take patience im slowly to reap the benefits of changing my lifestyle,1
park possibly buy something small in a local store my problems are mostly with the crowd and people who don't know very well or read sitting in a crowded park that's nearby lately I've been trying to praise the people around me and I'm starting to see some positive results what was the first activity that started with,1
"I would like to say ive overcome it completely yet, but I feel a lot better now compared to how I was a year ago where I just left my home by myself I would like to think of these things as challengesexperiments for example if you are afraid to walk the streets by yourself start by walking around the neighborhood where you still feel slightly anxious but much safer and keep doing until you feel like there is no more threat then go for bigger things then you have phone anxiety then mark strangers on purpose and act stupid then say you have the wrong number and hang up if you want to talk freely to a group of people around for example try to express yourself when there are only people for example you know baby steps I also tried to neutralize my anxious thoughts if an anxious thought would suddenly happen about a upcoming event I would try to calm myself down and say something like maybe it won't be as bad as I think wrong to do better this time I can not get to worry about what sometimes I have done this wrong before and I want to do well my next life I would like to die mantras such as I am completely independent of the good and bad opinion of others that I will also I care more about myself and I care more I care more about myself and I care more than I care about myself and I do it sometimes I care more than I care about myself and I care about myself and I do it myself and I do it myself because I care more I do it myself because I want to do it myself",1
"Jogs, walk is fine at least you know that your perception of love is not realistic loneliness will never go away despite getting a meaningful man unless you get to a point where you're happy with yourself at least reduce your smoke consumption less drink more water and go to jogswalks more often if you follow this will be substantially beneficial man the only way you can get completely on the way to progress is to forgive yourself to be self-compassionate your good to make mistakes as long as we use them as passing stones to keep writing you don't have to be nabakov or charles dikens to start taking baby steps instead of waiting for full recovery from yourself in an instant one thing that kind of fact with social anxiety and depression was to go to shit why I care too much about thinking that the world will end finally and nothing will matter from these people are anything in the big scheme of things that I'm nothing like as I have nothing to lose in everything that I want to do without this fear I have the right to live in this short life im i I can i can i that there's no time in your eyes really how I want to have nothing in the great scheme of things I want nothing to lose in all that I don't really",1
"walk, outdoors, park go out for a walk once a day additionally and slowly start to increase the time you spend out try to go to a different route every time it is not to cause too much stress if you live in a larger city or city go shopping instead of buying online call some businesses and just ask random questions about your product start going to a bar at first during the week later on weekends too you don't have to talk to people just take a drink and then go home after half an hour start doing sport either outdoors or in a gym if you trust her to talk to your friend about her problems if you can try to take your dog to a dog park or something so try to make small conversations with the other dog owners these are just some ideas, but please take it easy and don't overload the key is to slowly expand your comfort zone and your optimal performance area without entering into the area of danger ideally would do it under the supervision of a professional like a therapist if the topic is interesting so that looking for exposure therapy I hope you could help",1
"hiking, running yes but those thoughts have been improving recently you can be alone and still be happy for me personally I love hiking reading running etc no matter if I do all those things alone make me happy and I'm happy to make them find a hobby you can enjoy and then enjoy it no matter who comes together ironically to dedicate myself to personal hobbies has made it a little easier to talk to people if anyone ever asks about me I can talk about my hobbies talking about hobbies seems to be much easier than discussing my personal or professional life than kind of sucking",1
"out, walking, running a thing that really helped me out and around people going on walks around a trail was terrifying the first few times, but then I realized that nobody really cared that I was there is an easier and understandably difficult thing to start doing if you feel uncomfortable being around people even when there's no need to talk I tend to get anxious every time people can see me I liked the trails with a lot of turns so I wasn't constantly in people's eyes, but once I got used to it I had to force myself a couple of times I went to different paths that had a straighter way for a change of scenery their something alive made for a year and a half now that I really enjoyed doing multiple times a week I feel it for any mistake that I didn't really comment on things",1
Im day care close to your age and have had two jobs so far my social anxiety is very overwhelming but I realize that I need money to improve my life in the long term i.e. college rent funds etc. so here are some personal tips and volunteers local pet shelters are great for this because they accept all those who are willing and not a crazy trying to skin cats this will introduce them into the social work environment and if they are offered in a cloth shop or in a garden center something very small will help your anxiety my first job was in Walmart in the product section the worst they have to do is someone who asks you where the oranges are while they are allowed out an email in practice are much more popular than working at school and they call you to their first interview you can have a time to reschedule and ask questions about your time after one day you have to go back to your phone like anxiety so they are not allowed to leave a voice office that is never called to the university and you can make an interview time in the interview and you can make your phone,1
I think this is kind of a success that has suffered from social anxiety for many years and as a result have almost just hidden away at home this has made my social skills even worse to the point that even struggles with being around family members and I no longer have any friends who can see in person a year old boy without work experience and very few life skills this needs to change so this past month I have been doing more of an effort to improve things and I hope this is the beginning of me becoming more and more socially comfortable I recently started to see a support worker and she helped me to go out more together we have been exploring my local area and I am used to walking and generally being out of this has led to why im doing this post today I have recently joined a surprised gym I have always wanted to improve my fitness but lacking the motivation and initiative to do it at home is why I imagined that joining a gym would make sense because I would also force myself out more regularly your almost red and I have an introductory meeting at the gym in the hospicium im feelinging quite nervous and very tempted to avoid it the last day is lucky and I hope that I would not have a meeting on the day and I would have a meeting more regularly their almost red,1
"Out, walk, park definatley social anxiety bro the best advice you could give is to start using your microphone in video games to talk to people build their social skills with random people in video games and once you have developed your social skills enough where you are safe and then get out more go for a walk in the park go to the library or find something else to do you are forced to engage in conversation with random people maybe not right away, but eventually the best of luck",1
"walking, outside you have a dog if so take your dog to walk and talk to all the other pet owners who honestly do what I do or go walking alone if you feel comfortable and try to socialize with other people exercising and tell them that you're looking for a fellow exercise walk many people are exercising out more as the gyms are still closed",1
"Backpacker I think I know what you mean this sounds obvious, but trying to get your anxiety a little under control one of my ways is meditating sounds weird, but it really doesn't help after once, but after half a year I really started to see a difference starting tomorrow or tonight half an hour every day you'll learn to control your mind I also ran away from my group of friends for a while I threw myself in the backpacker depth across another country there's no one to judge then even a weekend away could help you feel free to send a message or answer if you have questions be careful",1
"Running, out trying to run out today was my first day bought cheap running equipment was cold and rainy but after running for minutes I came home and was so sweaty I took a warm shower and now I feel great",1
"Out, walk im younger than you but were almost the same the best way for me to go out is to go for a walk in the city late at night really help more there aren't many people out trying to go out for a walk in how I am youll enjoy it",1
running yeah my anxiety can be really exacerbated by the weeds ive found that if I have something and do yoga or exercise I go deeper into my practice and it's really beneficial but if I sit and watch TV while im high makes the anxiety so bad ive had some rather bad panic attacks while standing up from time to time I do guided meditations but mostly I just do yoga and running has become a moving meditation practice for me too I put hz and frequency music and just sit down with myself and its amazing what can come there a lot of different meditation methods I guess it's just about finding a way that resonates with you more,1
"football something short fast like coffee or fika don't know that word in English dessert or an activity where you talk less sports like the football gym, etc.",1
"nature, walking some kind of weekly class I'm not sure about yours, but my local community centers offer tons of art classes dance classes yoga pilates music weightlifting I started taking weekly ballet classes in an attempt to start dating there was scary at first but I quickly got used to it and really took several art classes gave me a lot of confidence I think the weekly classes are nice because you know what to expect week after week you grow comfortable with people in your classes that makes it easier to get to know them instead of seeing a group of different people each class and the routine that it is also very nice it is easier to convince yourself to go knowing that your fair part of your weekly routine also started to offer yourself once for a few hours in a rescue of animals that I work on my own in most cases but talk to the other volunteers from time to time it is kind of the nature of my volunteer work but you could volunteer with a food bank or a girls' club also started to offer yourself once for a week in a rescue of animals that would involve more social interaction you are out of home or making an example and I think about and in example for example people or in the example you might be willing to be willing to volunteer with a food bank or a few times or a few times to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a week to be a week to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a week to be a week or to be a week to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a week to be a week to be a week, to be a week to be a week to be a week to be a week to be a week to be a week to be a week to be a week to be a week to be a week, to be a week to be a week, or to be a week to be a week to be a week to be a week or to be a week or to be a few people to be a few people to be a few people, to be a few people or to be a few times or to be a few people or to be a few people, to be a few people or to be a few people or to be a few people, to be a few people or to be a few people, to be a few times or to be a few",1
"I'm not kidding, but I would say cold showers push-ups, move your body collides with something positive, for example cold water, obviously you want to live on some level, so remember why it's reminding you that you have a heart pumping blood into your veins and you're alive right now sounds like you're in a dark hole at the time and you've been in one too for many years, but the way out of that hole is not to talk to people on the Internet. I'm not hard. to be serious, but nothing will change until you change the messages you're saying. I can't fix anything positive. It's realetc if that's your belief, then that's going to be your reality. Change your thoughts and you see how quickly your outer reality changes that is a cosmic alchemy shit there son.",1
Walk im also went through a period of a month in which I didn't leave the house at all and when I did it was early morning or late pm to drip the grocery store the best advice I can give is to take it in baby steps first just try to take a minute on fast foot until the end of your street and back once you're comfortable with making it a little longer maybe walk to a nearby store without necessarily going in until you feel comfortable,1
"Walking sucks to lose friends sometimes spends life and friends split up and it's really sad sometimes it's a good thing to lose friends like your idiot friend who called you a bitch but let me tell you that friends are overrated recently I started doing things myself like going hiking to movie restaurants etc and I've never had so much fun I find that some activities can only really be enjoyed alone, especially when I have social anxiety",1
"running why I don't have any social anxiety at all after a minute run hey guys quick question recently discovered that if I run before a social event im the safest person of all time, especially with a beta blocker, but in the morning before exercise I put watery eyes in public feel hollow and struggle to keep eye contact without crying what is going on",1
out of just any people out when your dark so awesome and rain is the most relaxing feeling,1
"out, bike, sun totally worth man not even a question is hard to tell you what to do, but what I'm going to say is that I definitely don't think about it your whole challenge but the reward of being totally cool and quiet when you're there exceeds the effort of the next few weeks here the part where I mention all the things I could be doing to make it easier your mind to read go out of exercise and we've all heard this spiel and know how great they are all but they're probably great things that you can do during these two weeks and why not really read will occupy your mind while keeping you focused even entertained and going on a bike ride on a good day feels so good in the sun trust me man change your life for a little bit to see what it's like to be where you want to be putting in more effort on myself and your has been great really don't get used to that every day being a normal new then what used to be is progress",1
"walking, park you're probably very young and exaggerating some of your fears that are normal in pain I don't think you have agoraphobia otherwise you probably wouldn't even be in school assuming that the place you're afraid of that I understand the incompatibility I perceive but don't entertain this thought, as you're promoting a lot of social anxiety after all remember that she was the one who approached you and has nothing to lose if it doesn't work all you gain is the experience with the girls if the presence of your classmates in this relationship is causing as much anxiety as she knows everyone and would drag the attention mabey try to ask something simple a walk to a park or just a nearby cafe your scary hard jump from a cliff but I think if you manage to talk to her in a safer environment that school without gossip could calm the nerves down",1
"Running, running, horse, walking I agree that it's such a good feeling for me that I use to go running on this track in the field of an early school in the morning as, but now that the school has started not only can't run there, but there's like the fear of the morning hustle and bustle of the parents leaving the kids no matter where they run in the day is just the worst thing that many people also to make it worse than running very fast that I feel attracts a lot of attention to me and this is weird, but it's almost difficult for me to slow down I feel like im gallop like a horse or something that even walk much faster than normal",1
beach I do crafts like scrapbooking painting decoration right now I am redecorating my desk area with a beach theme because the beach is my favorite place is so soothing and reminds me of my most fun childhood moments,1

"park, walk I hate to tell you what you already know, but rehearsal and error is the best way of exposure therapy something I did for the first time when I started trying to improve my sa was to go to my local park and just go for walks I made a point to smile and nod everyone that I passed and finally gave a verbal salute there or hey I won't forget how difficult it was at the time and how far it comes because those days so bars and clubs don't really vibrate with you are my thing unless someone invites me but there are other points of sale if you have a local card store or table game store I would bet that you have weekly meetings and play mtg or monopoly this kind of places tend to attract a multitude of people with sa and as sure you can never guess that they are very welcoming people who also spend a lot of time with my sisters that honestly I can call my best friends who have helped me tremendously with my saive have a long way to go as you yourself with sa and as sure as they have never been in a relationship that they don't let me down through their daily struggle but trying to be very positive and very proud to be in a place that they do they do they do they do they know what they do they do they know what they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do it and what they do they do they do they do it and they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do what they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do what they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do what they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do",1

"Out yes as a side note don't tell your son that you are being rude for being quiet or my family are amazing selfless people of the time, but there was a day in my adolescence now when I felt quite uncomfortable because there were a few other people in the house and I made a point of going out with my sister instead of where it was less overwhelming I was later told by a fairly irritated family member how rude I was being to stay out of the way it was pure lack of understanding on her part she and the whole world are much more aware of my sa now but it really hurts me at the time because there was nothing I could do to change what I felt around others and the comment stayed with me in some ways made me even more hyperaware of how other people are perceiving me because I don't want them to think rude im and their always in the back of my mind",1

"nature maybe trying to find a hobby I bought a second hand d printer and have a lot of things to do with collecting metal detection made me come out in nature at least once a week exposure to sunlight increases levels of serotonin hobbies can fill a part of the vacuum pretty well not a perfect substitute by any means, but it seemed to me that it helped break the habit of weed weeds still very lonesome and failed im in life, but my hobbies offer me a glimpse of hope I still enjoy the things I have listed from time to time, but it is not an addiction imo and I try to avoid spending too much time that way",1
"Go take a walk to keep your notes and make peace and try to turn your mind off for a little bit honestly not think about what not to think about all that helps to sit on a chair close your eyes and focus on your breathing so that you can slow down then move your focus from your feet to your legs to your back all the way to your head and try to really feel the way your feet are in your shoes touch the ground how the back of your thighs is touching the chair, etc. Ketera is a way of mindfulnessning this for some time allows you to say minutes make up then get out of that hotel room and take your notes with you go for a walk try to focus on your senses the smells the winds and the possible temperature the sun burning your skin may not read your notes a little while walking offers you the opportunity to still read it but focus your attention on something more at the same time I hope that this will help good luck and even if something you anticipated that is not a bad thing and not the end of the world your just a maximum minute will pass",1
"parkour link from another post made me feel like I would like to get a little enjoyment of socializing that would help lift my mood make me lively and not so robotic that it would also allow me to do more hobbies that could be more based on society or public as parkour free running trick bboying popping and other kinetic forms of expression that I would get to go where all the artists are and interact with them exposure to that world with people of mind etc. I am having difficulty articulating this, but ultimately I would breathe in life I feel so empty right now",1
"out, jog, running you and I were in the same place years just any real experience of life sick from studying to work when we can not even find ways to enjoy free time out of it we have to do something completely different that I have been contemplating since the last semester started to abandon and then do something drastic that is totally out of what I have done before growing too apathetic and careless in this state I must travel or something and get to see life more so I don't feel so carefree I thought that moving out would be the beginning of me I would force myself to get out more but its opposite I have the extra stress of having to take care of myself but now I can completely isolate and not look for people every day and I don't have parents or siblings who have guests or even people I have to talk to the last weekend I talk to anyone for days in a row and now im im im I'm also going to get depressed and make me work at the best place of the week I have to work slower and I don't get behind my studies but usually week I don't like to play the girls of the week more than I have I'm going to go to go to go to the truth I's also I'll and I'll I'm going to make I'll and I'm going to do I's death im",1
And I couldn't stop thinking that everyone hated me and I was weird even no one was like that to me and when I had social anxiety years ago in school when I started people I sat away from my friends I usually say next to school and I was wondering what to do and they said to me that I could only talk to people and social anxiety I literally ruined my life every night that I was going to be friends with a lot of people and go out to be pathetic and distance my own people from every school except that a few close friends would tell me to myself and they would tell me that they hated me and they thought that I could only make the bus to school a nightmare for me every night that I went like sleep hours except for the weekends and that I would make the whole night that I didn't go to school that I was going to school that I was going to the street and that I was going to the street and that I was going to the street and to the street and to the street with that I was going to the street and to the street and the street that I was going to the street,1

"running, run I feel like this most of the time too but ive note it helps when I focus on improvable skills I beat up about not be charismatic enough or smart enough but you know what I can improve on performing piano writing painting etc has been very good for my self-esteem focusing on activities like these is like that cliché saying that just focusing on being better than you were yesterday except your true type lol your certainly isn't something that comes naturally but when you start setting goals and meeting them your incredibly rewarding and healthy live never felt particularly good at anything, but now I can say that I run and that's better than nothing",1
", park ill try to give some tips, but take it as it will be enough at the bottom of the rock to say here I'll be like I try to think about it I know my weaknesses and strengths for example im good at staying in my house all day isolating me in my im bad room in my social skills if your little talk asking for directions making friends ec wrong I'm going to make a list of things in a spectrum through what is easier and what it is the worst to talk worse to a random girl on the street seeing easier maybe going into the bookstore to check the most recent book selection once you discover the problems is much easier to dissect how to solve it and since bad im in all the bad thing has to learn from the bottom idk if this is a real date but everything in life is a skill all you need is determination and practice to become a teacher of circumstances that we don't dominate socializing as children are supposed to happen socializing is a skill that is going to be known in the practice of the most difficult things, maybe you'll go to see more of life or even the mood that you won't dominate socializing even happen very well",1

"walking, out of which I have no problem with at all passing or if I am interacting with them as I walk down the street, for example lately I have been trying to walk with my head up making eye contact and smiling at most women who walk through me, although sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes they look at me then look out very fast or just look at me and look down sometimes in my head I feel like I'm being disgusting to look at and smile at them when I walk by but I have to get rid of that mindset at work I always make eye contact and smile but when I start interacting with them anxiety hits me like a brick wall and then bad usually look away id love at least start taking it another step maybe say something to them as I am standing up to cross the street waiting outside etc etc but I'm not sure where to start what you suggest tips or tips",1
executing second this execution or any physical activity that you like really helps me put things into perspective I think being around people that makes anxiety go crazy really messes with my priorities I really don't want to care what others think just what I think of myself and when I'm around people and so self-conscious I become someone who molds myself to what others need that I don't like running really helps me re-establish this mentality after being around people for a long time,1

walk it true for I have realized that more and more in my college life especially as the classes got more demanding and I had to trust other people in my classes have been team-based and I mean mandatory team projectspresentations which means I can't just study my ass alone in my home more trying to be part of a team constantly putting stress on me presentations are a nightmare I have fought during my internships because of my bad social skills but I managed to study computer engineering and I thought I could be a programmer genius and code all day long but no matter what your work is social skills are one must im say this to scare you but what I have learned even in the college world I have seen many people who pass by because they spend with the best students who share the best grades getting acquainted with teachers etc and I don't do it so much with pure work and dedication during this time I have handled through difficult situations I have somehow improved my social skills but I still have to make many people see you every day that you go to work little for yourself it's a lot easier if you don't have friends who have their network in case you have to work with other people in the future you and I have to do you in the other people in the way I have to do you in the future I have you and I somehow I have to do you in the way I have to do you in some way I have you in the way my social skills but I have you but I have you but I have to do in the way I have you in the way I's I's that I's that I's that I's I's that I's that I's that I's I've learned I's it I's that I's I's I's that I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I's I've learned,1
"I'm not as serious as having to drop out of school, but it was pretty close to her some things that I can tell you my attention something I should practice more than but my attention is a form of meditation to help get your mind out of a constant state of thinking that is to say, if others are judging me and it takes you to a full focused state look at my attention audio sessions or something like that in google there is a lot of tutorials and things to help you not break the chain of his something that the famous comedian Jerry Sienfeld talked about is a comedian who has done so many routines standing up to make it seem so unlikely that he is able to make my account that in google it's much more than a special hour that he mentioned it was something he calls not to break the chain or in other words he would write a joke every day that I needed to do something good or not, but I do it every day that I have to do my account of what I do more than I care about is a lot more than what I have to do a little more than I have to do than I do a little more than I do than I do than I do than I do than I do than I have to do than I do a little bit more than I do than I do than I do than I do it.",1
"walking dirt and breathing techniques work for some people prefer to listen to music giving a walk or a bath, etc. doing an activity you enjoy can sometimes take your mind from your worries, but I personally understand that thoughts can get overwhelming no matter what you are doing work little by little to relax will help you master the ability in my experience as an anxious person could not just immediately relax your time to find out what works by testing some things maybe make a list of what you like to do or Google relaxation techniques and try to take note of the way it makes you feel and try to implement some techniques in your daily schedule",1
"Jogs, walking like the other guy girl said that his diet mostly reduced in carbohydrates and sugar and trying to totally eliminate the sugary dairy drinks can help a lot too and for the boost and help that the exercise makes you go jogging at night assuming that you live in a safe area which is what I do between me and I no one is ever out cars could drive but at that time they are usually too busy thinking that I hate my life for being so late im so tired that they won't pay attention in my months of walking at night I never saw someone even look at me from their car or you can work at their house while watching television",1

nature if you have any access to counseling or a loved one I would listen to I don't know if it would help but it helps me look for nature when I feel hopeless and useless it takes me out of my head to see animals and plants even if you were homeless it would still be you and that it's beautiful you're strong because of the life the universe has given you and the way your mind works I know that you can persevere through this id be me for a few hours until I decide to end myself,1
"walking, out after I haven't left the house for a while or even days it feels scarier to leave the house again, but even though after going out I get used to it and realize that it's not so bad maybe starting small as walking to the mailbox sitting outside your house taking a short walk and then starting to do bigger things",1

nature helps reduce my social anxiety when I don't see porn I don't compare with other better people and I feel less inferior and therefore less anxiety anxiety is triggered mainly by inferiority complexes in my case also when it doesn't turn off every day for hours youll have more time to get social exposure or being in nature that helps social anxiety also more energy and slightly higher levels of testosterone resulting in less anxiety,1
"Run, out I realized the other day while I was sitting in my rooms looking through my window that rain is actually my favorite thing in the whole damn world now every time it starts raining run out and I stay there feeling fucking alive and happy what I never do and when I go to sleep at night I love to have my window open and feel the little splash of water bounce in my face and smell that smell of rainy earth and hear it spill I love the rain so much this was super detailed ahaha but I just know how you feel ps for feminine im context",1
walking a walk in the rain can be very nice and refreshing as long as I im wrapped tight and dry in it,1
swimming depends on what you mean quickly I think someone can overcome anxiety in a week with the right environment and full of commitment and commitment if by fast you mean to rush too much to the point of not really working on yourself but rushing into short-term corrections then progress will finally be slow to try to imagine yourself without anxiety what would be the first thing you want to do or if you prefer to answer the question what you really enjoy in life this can be anything no matter how small a song can be that you like eating an activity a person a clothing item that you like to wear a place that you like to do cleaning tasks my drawing would be swimming the weightlessness that you feel drifting in the water and the sounds splashing around me would be great to hear what would be yours would be,1
"walking obviously none of us are doctors here, but it sounds like you're going through depression that might be an idk phase im lucky enough that when I get depressed by the body brain it automatically bounces back after a week or so ive heard that one of the best ways to help yourself overcome it is to pick up some small hobbieschores basically focus on doing something when you come back from school doesn't even need to be something big that starts small like reading a few pages of a book clean your bathroom or take a walk andxb",1
How to meet someone who has suffered social anxiety I recognize myself in your situation and I think that many other people ask the first question to you are you a player or have another similar time consuming hobbies if you have recommended going cold turkey at it until graduation so that you can focus on preparing for the future as well as participating in activities that will reduce your anxietyanthen I recommend you try to have a future job if having a college education improves your chances of fulfilling your dreams gives the university what you are dedicated to deciding what you want to do for the future will ask you what your dream job would be then do research on what you should do to get closer to having that job than research employers you want to work to make it easier gives you to the university what you do to your business will let you know if you want to study or immediately start working your time to achieve your goal universities that you want to apply to your research employees that you would like to apply to research employers that would like to work for what matters to you will matter a long time you will care about yourself,1
I think that many of us with social anxiety get stuck in a negative feedback loop I know for myself girls personally I would like but I wouldn't do any kind of movement because I was nervous so while other people are getting into relationships and it's not easy to think that the reason is that im not attractive enough use to fight with this much too yxb im married now I met my future wife in the bedroom where we lived during college we became close friends for about a year before we finally got romantically involved for me just really open up and be myself once I get close to someone so I think that's what really helped our relationship yxb that it was also that you're in therapy but you've tried any im medication in paxil propanol and klonopin and that it helped tremendously if you want to stay on prescription drugs it seems to me that I also found that blessryll and cbd oil to help the mother do a hard job that makes you easier and that people who makes you easier and easier than you can do in life makes you easier and easier than you can make it easier.,1
