3y7rva,running,"Self worth and anxiety. Hi guys. 25 (M) I am new here. I just had a question for ya Do you think anxiety is tied to you self worth? I have always felt if I was financially stable, independent form my parents (horrible relationship with dad extreme verbal abuse as a kid, not that good of relationship with family overall, also was teased a lot in school ). And if I was successful ( I have been before, which did wonders for my confidence while in college ) I felt that all my anxiety would just drift away and I would be alright. When I get nervous I start to sweat extremely bad in my face, and its super embarrassing. I know its all physiological and how I view my self, and how I think others are viewing me. When I turned 19 I first tired bettering my self. Started working out, got hobbies,writing,running,reading, (photography) which is my sort of my profession now. Staring to be more serious about life. I had even tried nofap for 2 months. And I wont lie doing all this gave me amazing confidence. I even sating dating a track star at my school! Thing were going great, but still something was amiss. I still had to call mom and dad for cash, still had to listen to there complain about money and fighting with them even through I was off at college. I got the sweats less, but still had them and still got panic attacks around people. Around 22 I ended up trying Xanax for a while which made everything perfect. Then I realized that this quick fix I could not use forever and I gave it up which sucked (withdraw). I really don't want to go back to it. It ended up controlling me I felt I needed all the time to keep up my ""persona"" 2015 has be the worst year of my life After breaking my leg, having my room mate move out (which ruined my credit) on top of that losing a ton of money for medical and surgery and physical therapy(had to sell most all my possessions) , running out of money for college, forcing me to move back with my parents for almost a year now(which as been hell for me been super depressed and such). Almost joining the army to get my life back on track sine that looked like the only window of hope. Then last month ended up winning a photo grant for 10k. Now in 1 in a half months when I get the cash I am going to travel abroad for 4/5 months see the world (got the travel bug last year) and get back to my life and pursuing my passion(writing and photography) and after my trip moving to LA with one of my best friends. Also back in school online atm till I move back to California to finish my degree. So ya things are looking really good right now! I really think getting my life back on track will cure my anxiety( this will be the fist time in my life I am a 100% independent, For some reason I feel like this is it. I will be cured ). Always when I gained something, (success,confidence,hobbies, sense of focus) my anxiety got less. Am I being to hopeful ? Please guys give me ya thoughts and stories!",1

4gpbsy,run,"You are not your inner critic.. Hey everyone. I wrote this a while ago to cope with some real life issues and stumbled upon it recently. I thought this sub might like it. There is an inner critic behind each thought and each word typed out in front of me. None of my writing has to make any sense to anyone but me, but it’s as if it’s in my nature to have it make sense for others as well. Words are just used to express feelings and thoughts that I have in order to relate to another individual with similar experiences. And so other people also have thoughts and feelings that they try to convey through their words, but I wonder how often those thoughts and feelings get mixed up or portrayed inaccurately when they’re trying to convey something. Maybe we all have difficulties expressing who we really are deep down. Our inner most self is rarely seen by others. If we can pull down the curtain for others to see our true self we will not hesitate to do it. There must be some circumstances in place to do so. First off you must trust in that other individual completely. If you can’t open yourself up to another person’s opinions then you will not be able to convey your inner most self to others. You must trust that you can handle whatever another person throws at you. Other people are unpredictable and that’s flawed… Other people are good deep down, but their thoughts and feelings can also be misconstrued like ours. We see the thoughts behind our actions, but rarely do we see others for their thoughts. Their actions are much more easily seen. Their actions are instantly seen and judged rather than pondered like they should be. Everyone is trying to deal with their own demons and we are no different. The struggles of humanity come from the same seed of despair. We are all struggling with the purpose of our existence. Some seek refuge in faith, while others escape to different worlds through books or video games. There are no surefire ways to live our lives in this world. We are all given this opportunity through the sheer coincidence that the universe has created for us. There is no tangible thing that will bring us the peace that we seek. That peace can be found within ourselves and through the bonds that we forge as we live on. The people around us are also suffering, so we might as well take solace in the idea that we are not alone in our suffering. Our scars may look different on the outside, but they all harbor the same feelings of sadness and despair. These feelings pave way to the love that exists only when we’re vulnerable with one another. It’s no secret that we won’t be on this earth forever. Why waste time judging others for their misdeeds or interests when you could be enjoying life? It’s a pity, really. We’re all so engrossed in ourselves that we rarely see others for who they really are. They’re all like me. They all have loved ones. They all would love to make a friend who they can spend time with. They all want something to believe in. As I’m typing this, other people are also living their lives in their own worlds. My world may be different from theirs, but each world is valid in its own right. I don’t need to fear the criticism of other people. That brain power can be spent on solving my problems, rather than exacerbating them. The biggest hurdle in my 20 years of being on this earth so far is challenging that inner critic that tells me what I should be. It tells me what I shouldn’t do more often than not. It tells me I’m not good enough to stand amongst my peers and be myself. That inner critic is as real as me, but it doesn’t have to be if I loosen its grip on me. When I run that inner critic comes out and realizes it has no power. It keeps saying “I can’t do it. I should just give up. I don’t like this pain.” After a while that voice realizes the futility in its words. Overcoming that voice in one area of life shows just how it can be achieved in all other areas. Persistent effort is the key to any positive change. It takes more than a few words of encouragement to get past this inner critic. It takes determination and it takes time. Nothing happens instantly. No real change can be done in a day. Habits form and within those habits are the key to a good life.",1
4vmwlg,"running, run, runs, walk, horse, jogging","Just Started Running - A Question to My Socially Anxious Friends. With the new month, I started running again. Always has been one of my favorite things. I try to leave the house by 6 AM to beat the arrival of people being that I run at a school's track, kinda a popular running area. Somebody arrived right when I was leaving which made me feel like they thought I was leaving because of them. Plus to make things worse I was laughing when she got there because that episode of friends ""The One Where Phoebe Runs"" popped into my head. How Rachel says when Phoebe runs ""She looks like a cross between Kermit the frog  and the six million dollar man."" I was laughing out of control. Anyways my question to y'all. What do you do when you run/ walk by somebody on the street. I would go to the other side of the road back when I was younger walking home from school. But that's such an asshole move, or is that just me in my head? What would you do? PS: Oh  and I'd like to add I run (  and walk ) really fast. This is so annoying because I will get so much unwanted attention. I don't know if its the way my legs are but if I try to run slower I feel like I'm galloping like a horse. Jogging really slow is just the most uncomfortable awkward thing. So because of this I will like lap people on the track if anyone's there. Just the awkward icing on the cake.",1

But from what I've read it more applys ""at the same time every year"". I might be more depressed at certain times, but I'm extremely ""effected"" by SA  and depression like year round. Just at certain times I'm slightly less. I made a post about this recently but I like rambled way to much so just thought I'd rephrase it. I've been incredibly depressed from my SA. This being my worst year, with the suicidal thoughts etc non stop. But the reason I'm holding on is because I really want to experience the fall / cold times again. I will sit outside in the cold for hours, take long walks dressed from head to toe. I also just feel more comfortable, less anxious covered up.

5e1ixb,outside," Studying.. Do you guys study by yourselves? I feel like people who are more social and study in groups tend to do better than people who study on their own. It makes sense because in a group, people can all share their own output and one person may be able share knowledge that no-one else knew. For example, I was having trouble understanding a concept for a quiz that I had last week, so i said, ""Fuck it"", and went to school early to study in the library and maybe ask for help. As I went to the library I saw a group of my classmates studying together for the exam. At first I was hesitant of approaching and asking for help, but I forced myself to do so because I realized that the pros of understanding the class material and challenging my social anxiety were greater than the cons of avoidance and not knowing anything on the quiz. So I went up to them and said, ""Hey guys. Do you understand how to do the problems because I am completely stuck."" Then it went on from there. After we did some of the problems, we conversed about a bunch of different topics and I actually enjoyed it. I think I still didn't do that well on the quiz but many people seemed to have trouble on the same questions as me. It would've been way worse if I didn't ask for help. One last thing I realized was that for the past few weeks, I've noticed that I dislike being at home alone all the time. Instead of skipping class or other outside events, I want to go. I wasn't like that before. I would always dread heading outside. I think it's getting better now though. It's not a rapid change, but I can see improvement and I'm feeling more comfortable in my own skin. ",1
5i0sxd,"walk, running, jog","Reducing your Social Anxiety. I wanted to put this together to help as many people as possible that are trying to function with social anxiety, which as you already know, can be extremely hard. I also want to say that in no way, shape, or form have I defeated social anxiety. These are tips, advice, and helpful things that can and will improve your quality of life and diminish your social anxiety. Most of this comes from my own experiences and also from what people have said about their own experiences in reducing/overcoming social anxiety. These will not only improve your anxiety but also your life in general. Stop masturbating and stop watching porn(if you do): A big reason for a lot of people's social anxiety is masturbation and porn. I won't get into the specifics too much but a orgasm from porn triggers a neurotransmitter to go off in your brain in a very large amount called dopamine. Such a large amount and especially at a high rate(if you orgasm to porn a lot) can cause anxiety, depression, among other things. Stopping this alone can do so many things. Able to talk to girls better, more energy, and being relaxed in social situations are all benefits of stopping this. Also if you are addicted to porn and masturbation(which might be you) this may be harder then usual. For most people that are addicted, full benefits are usually seen about 90-110 days after stopping. This is the time is takes to rewire your brain. Also the time may vary depending on the severity of your addiction. Healthy diet: Stay away from sugars. To be a healthy person, doctors say we should only have 37g of sugars a day. To put that in perspective a regular pack of skittles has 46g of sugar. An excess amount of sugar also triggers the dopamine transmitter which as you know, can do bad things. Stay away from sugar as much as possible. It is not good for you in any way. Try going after healthier things which can have great effect on your mood and anxiety. Cold showers: Not only do cold showers build willpower, they also are proven to decrease depression and build testosterone, which can help your anxiety tons. Cold showers are also very refreshing and can provide you with much more energy. The next chance you get, take a cold shower(not a cool shower) and see how you feel afterwards. I honestly didn't know what to expect but when getting up for school or work, they can take the grogginess away and you'll feel much more capable of tackling the challenges the day presents. Limiting time spent on phone/TV: So much of us with social anxiety get caught into this lifestyle where we're always on our phones, games, TV. Don't get trapped into this lifestyle. Do activities and build hobbies that you will enjoy. Start reading a novel. Start playing a sport. Do something other then coming home from work or school everyday and going straight to the TV. Exposure to social interactions: Some of us hide away or avoid social interactions or things that give us anxiety. One of the best ways to become more comfortable and relaxed when in these social situations that you dread is by doing them. Build your confidence and experience in these situations. Greater anxiety in the present is less anxiety in the future. I'll tell you how I am currently doing some of these things. 1. My job: I got a job at Monkey Joes. If you don't know what that is, it's a inflatable place where kids and families can come to jump around and have birthday parties/gatherings. Part of my job is hosting parties. Which means in front of 16-60 people I have to host a party. Also this party is in somewhat a enclosed room where most of the time people are standing/sitting right next to eachother. I have to give out orders, make sure the mom and dad of the birthday boy/girl are satisfied, help with anything that needs to be done. Also I have to speak in front of all these people and let them know what to do. My first party, I was terrified. I've now down about 5-6 and guys, I can't even put into words the difference this has already had on me. This helped me in so many ways like being in big groups, walking into places(like classrooms) with a lot of people and so forth. It's amazing the difference something can make when all you have to do is just simply apply yourself. School: As much as I can, I try to ask questions, and start conversations. I've made so many friends this year that I wouldn't have imagined making a year ago. Try to ask questions and talk to people your interested in talking too. Join a Toastmasters club(when you are ready): A toastmasters club is a group of people who meet up and give speeches to each other to better their skills at public speaking. This is a great way to challenge yourself and anxiety. It's also a great way to become a better public speaker which is a good skill to have. Running/working out: Not only does this get you in better shape but running or working out can build testosterone and also release a lot of built up anxiety. As you know, testosterone is good for people with anxiety. It can build confidence. If I've had a stressful day or have a lot of anxiety, I'll go on a 30min-hour jog with music and feel tons better afterwards. Drugs: Stop smoking weed: I used to smoke weed a lot. I think it actually had to do something with causing my social anxiety. I stopped smoking weed and felt loads better in the future. THC is linked to causing social anxiety so watch out for that. Not only did this help my anxiety but I was also able to focus on my school and sports much more. My focus in the classroom was also improved. Meditation: I, personally, have not tried meditation before. As you've probably heard though, it can do some pretty good things. People have said it's worked wonders in their life. Look up good techniques and try them. Also, if you do meditate, feel free to comment on your techniques and some benefits meditation has. Be prepared: When in school, knowing what the class is about or what the discussion is about gives me way more confidence then if I don't know what anything is about and I'm clueless. I've found that when I'm actively doing my homework, studying for tests, and maintaining a high grade, I have less anxiety/more confidence in the class and also around my peers. Don't just do the work or get by with a D. Become actively engaged in what's being taught and you will find yourself very intrigued and applying yourself more. Limit Stress: Sometimes, life is very overwhelming. Try to get things done beforehand and create a schedule of events/things that need to be done. You already have anxiety as it is, don't stress yourself out even more with things that need to be done. Get things done ahead of time to where you feel you have an adequate amount of time to yourself. Respect yourself and value yourself. Don't cheat yourself by letting deadlines go back and slipping up on due dates. Your only digging a deeper hole for yourself. I hope this can help you and your anxiety.",1
5l9a79,"walk, sun","""She'd rather stay alone."". I am visiting a German host family I used to live with. I don't know why I thought three weeks would be an appropriate amount of time spent here. In retrospect, one day would have been plenty. Anyway today, the family are having two get-togethers. Right now (lunch), they have the mother's parents over. In total, there are six people: Father, Mother, Son, Brother of Mother, Mother of Mother, Father of Mother. Later (dinner) there will be some other people, I believe again there will be a total of six people who will stay for a second christmas and until New Year's. Anyway so as per usual, I'm alone in bed still. I've decided to spend the day doing positive things to keep my mood up as I usually get really depressed during celebrations, and I know tonight at midnight will be rough. So I'm writing on my journal now (while redditing), daydreaming about positive things, I will later continue to plan a project I'm doing, read a book I am absolutely in love with, eat the best food in the neighbourhood and stuff my face, go on a walk when the sun goes down and brace myself for midnight. But anyway as they were about to eat lunch, the father asks me ""Would you like to join us? It's totally okay if you say no."" and so I tell him ""I would rather be alone."" in my most apologetic voice. I know the Father and the Mother are used to my antics. I lived with them for a year, and barely saw them. They know I have social anxiety and have come to accept and respect it. I still feel bad whenever I decline spending time with them but six people, three of which I am not really used to? Too much. Arg I'm tearing up just thinking about it. Anyway. So as he leaves, he announces to the others ""She would rather be left alone!"" and then closes the kitchen/livingroom door. I feel so damn embarrassed and annoyed at myself. It's like I've actually failed them, and they're getting annoyed at me as well. Part of me wants to leave early because now it's just ridiculous. I've been here for 11 days and have spent the last four or so in bed all day, sneaking out to eat, shower or brush my teeth only when they're away or too busy/loud to hear me. I hate myself. I truly do right now.",1

79e4q8,"walk, outside","Story of me beating social anxiety!!. Warning: this is going to be a long post. Hello, I just joined this sub Reddit and created this account just for the sake of getting my social life back in control. Before i go any further i would love to talk about where i was 4 years ago. Since i was a kid i always wondered why i am I so weird. Why can't i do social stuff like everyone else, why am I always scared, why do i stutter when i have attention of a group of people. These questions always were in my head until when day i found out about social anxiety and finally i was like i have the answer. Now i can look for a solution to treat my social anxiety. I think i was like 16 when i found out about social anxiety, although i was in India at that time so didn't had much support for it plus basic teenage stuff was going on in life. Getting bullied, being ashamed of being skinny which hurt my self esteem really bad, not being able to express my feeling to the girl i liked. All of this made my anxiety worse and i started to avoid people. Move forward to the age of 19 i come to new York, i feel now my life is gonna change. Somehow magically being in new York will turn me into some confident social bird. But i was wrong, i started college and things aren't changing i am still anxious around people have low self esteem, don't have a gf, skinny sf plus i am developing depression now. On top of that my mindset is changing into a mindset of a victim, i always feel like i am being attacked by people. This goes on for few more years and somehow i survive. Now I am 21, fucked up. Social anxiety is so bad that i can't even get out of house. I fucked up my semester in college and gpa is all fucked up. All i do is play league of legends whole day and i am only eating like one meal a day. Plus i am broke af don't even have money for food. I had it enough i said i have to change myself and will have to take control over my life. I had this burning feeling inside my body which i couldn't get rid of. So i started to taking, i did the following: 1. For first month i practiced getting out of house. I would go carts thinking about how do i get out of house. But i committed to it sometimes i would just walk outside for a minute and comeback. 2. Second month started to take walk outside house. My goal was to take walk a in places with lots of people, which is easy to do since i live in nyc. While walking my goal was to observe my anxious thoughts and try not to react to it. I read this book called power of now, where i learned about this concept of observing your thoughts. 3. Next I got a job as a salesperson. Holy shit that was a nightmare i have no idea how i even survived that, it was just crazy i wasn't event able to talk yo customers. I wanted to avoid that but i had no choice. 4. In college my goal was to ask questions in class. It was awkward though but i had made up my mind. I am not going to live like this, i have to beat this social anxiety. Now fast forward to 2017, one of my best years in life man. 1.I crushed it this year, i started my ecommerce business for which i worked my ass off and now i am making decent money. I am also about to launch my own social media agency. Plus i am part to so many entrepreneurial communities on social media. 2. Last semester i had one class where i would i was the most social person. Everyone knew me, i would make jokes and stuff. 3. I joined gym and went from 115lb skinny dude to 140 lb guy although i haven't been going regularly to gym recently. 4. Went to tony Robbins event unleash the power within! It was really crazy crazy. I am really into self development and tony is one my favorite person i look upto. 5. I went on a trip. 6. I tried to pickup girls, lol. It's fun but it's scary at times. And more stuff which will only make this post longer. How did i do it? I really believe that what we focus on is what we become. So my whole life i focused on social anxiety but in last few years i have changed my focus from anxiety, depression to the person i want to become. I try to focus more on what my goal is and how can i achieve it. Also i feel you have to have a sense of like enough is enough. Frustration and anger have always been my fuel, they give me so much energy to push myself further and further. Do i get anxiety? Yes feel it everyday it's just matter of taking control over it. Decide if you want to give in to anxiety or you want to win over it. Also i recently read something cool about anxiety, instead of trying to call yourself being anxious call yourself as being excited as anxiety and excitement are similar emotions. So by doing this whole meaning changes. Although i haven't been doing things i used to do and getting kind of comfortable. Recently i started to stutter when asking questions in front of big group so i have start working on social skills again. Ask me anything guys. You want to message, do that. I will do anything to help you need any advice. I am here to grow and help others grow. Peace🙏",1

7tn3e6,jogging,Upcoming 21st birthday rant. How did you spend yours?. I turn 21 next month and for the longest my sister (because I have virtually no friends) has been bubbling with ideas on what to do. It’s her boyfriends birthday too and they’ve decided to celebrate both of ours at a bar. Now this bar is a very ‘involved’ one. It’s one of those “ hey table 2 number #_ come up and sing”- or some shit. They’re also inviting a shit load of strangers. Of the little friends I have I’m the first to be 21. Needless to say it’s been keeping me up recently and I’m having nightmares about it. For the longest I’ve been hinting about not wanting to go. And last night I finally broke it to her. I tried to be as serious as I could and went “Hey I don’t wanna celebrate my birthday doing anything.” And just like- explained to her that I’m not comfortable going there. She ended up laughing in my face and saying “you’re going.” And it just really pissed me off and we went back and forth. She eventually texted me apologizing and saying I don’t have to go. I know many people might go “you really need to get out of your comfort zone.” But it’s not that damn easy. I’d like to think I made great strides just last year. I regularly leave the house for shopping or to go jogging. I finally got a job. I even went alone to get my first piercing and it was great. But I just cannot do a fucking bar- not at this point in time. I don’t even like celebrating my birthday and never even imagined I’d like going to a bar. I don’t know the whole deal just pissed me off. More-so because at this point I feel like my family should understand I have issues and how much it affects me. But they honestly don’t and they don’t believe anything I say I have. I’m just wondering how long it’ll take for them to realize I’m not okay. Do I have to go “hey mom I’m not happy ever and I always feel like I’m gonna have a heart attack!” “hey mom I think about suicide a whole lot!” Anyways I just wanted to rant- how did everyone else spend their 21st birthday?,1

9atudo,bike,"Don't do this alot.. I'll Try to keep it short.. I'm 22 years old and I've been struggling with sa for most of my life.. Going through school/college, I found it difficult to interact with people. When I did; I would stutter, blush/sweat, Find it hard to keep eye contact and wish I never even spoke.. So I try to find a way to avoid talking people.. I haven't had a real life friend since 2011/12 and I don't go out of the house much either, When I do I only go out on my bike to keep fit and it helps when I feel depressed. After years of struggling with sa, I eventually made an appointment to talk to my doctor about it and told him that I had social anxiety and was wondering what he could do to help me.. he told me to speak to the college counsellor, I told her everything after a few sessions.. She told me from what I told her I have severe generalized social anxiety disorder and told me to go back to my doctor and ask for medication. I didn't make another appointment to see my doctor again because I found it too difficult and embarrassing the first time.. The only person I've spoke to in my family about it is my brother, That's because he has social anxiety himself but not as extreme as I have it.. I haven't spoke to my parents about it and I don't think I ever will.. What should I do?",1

bkns57,outside,"Blushing. Hello. I’m a 23 year old guy. I just joined this subreddit, and I’m looking for answers. I grew up extremely shy and extremely short. Shorter than everyone in class, even shorter than the girls. Somewhere along the lines (probably around 14/15 years old) I stopped being shy, and started being very social. At 18 I lost a lot of weight and became very good looking which helped a lot too. To this day I feel very confident, and I’m very good in social settings BUT I’ve developed a deep fear of blushing. It all started when a friend jokingly screamed “why are you blushing?!” In a crowded place randomly, and since that day I’ve had the fear of blushing. I function just fine outside because of wind and fresh air, also when it’s dark (in the club, movie theatre etc). But in a light and warm environment the fear intensifies, and I usually end up blushing BECAUSE I think so much about it. Is there anyone else here who experience the same thing? Any tips?",1
bmrze1,"outside, walk, basketball","How I Got Rid of my Social Anxiety (Not a Panacea, but things that helped me). First of all, I know this post is long, bear with me. I’m writing this post to be the message I wish I could’ve read 2 years ago. If I had understood then what I understand now, I could’ve saved myself so much pain, embarrassment, and loneliness. I hope his helps someone out there. Even if your experience is somewhat different, I guarantee there is something in what I’ve been through that might help make sense of it all. **TLDR**: I went from fully socially comfortable, surrounded by friends, outgoing and friendly, to depressed, thinking anxious thoughts all time, desperately uncomfortable around other people. At that point, I did everything I could to figure out what went wrong, and how I could fix this terrible problem. The two main factors in the development of my social anxiety were an addiction to my phone/computer/Netflix/Reddit/Youtube, and increasing isolation from other people. **How my Social Anxiety Developed** A little background about my life. When I was young, basically up until high school, I never had a problem with anxiety. I spent tons of time with my friends, perfectly fine social skills, played sports, no problems with depression or anything like that. I’m 22 years old now, just finished four years of college. I think kids growing up today are dealt a much harder hand than I had. Internet addiction and compulsive smartphone usage played a huge role in my becoming isolated, anxious and depressed, and I imagine there are lots of kids out there who are maybe going through something similar, but without the foundation of a normal social childhood/early years. I started to develop anxiety around other people in high school. I had friends in school, through classes and sports, but didn’t spend much time with them outside of school. At the end of the day I would usually go home and spend time on Reddit, Youtube, Netflix or watch pirated movies and TV shows. My family had some serious problems, so I didn’t like to spend time with them. I would just go into my room alone, and try and take my mind off my problems with entertainment. My family was pretty poor, so I’d be hungry often, not have a lot of energy, and just want to unwind in bed with my laptop. I spent a lot of time doing that, especially over the summers. I went off to college and everything turned around for me. I was lucky enough to live in a college dorm with some great, kind, wonderful people, and I became good friends with many of them. I made an active effort to spend time with my friends, and I had social interaction every day. It became so easy for me to spend time with people. I was the happiest I’d ever been, and figured I’d grown from my awkward high school days and I was cured. I didn’t realize it could ever be like that again. My senior year things became worse for me than they’d ever been. I’m not proud of how I responded to a difficult year, but I honestly did not understand what was wrong with me, or how to fix it. I was swamped with difficult classes on top of working 20hrs a week at a job I hated. I had a bad habit of procrastinating until the last minute, and it caught up with me. I became constantly sleep deprived, was close to broke all the time so I started barely eating, just trying to will my way through the work I had to get done. I started finding it incredibly difficult to focus on reading technical research articles, having to go back and reread paragraphs over and over again. I became terribly uncomfortable just answering questions in class. When I started missing assignments and classes, I avoided my friends so I wouldn’t have to explain. My mind started to become uncomfortable, even alone. I numbed the pain and constant anxiety by going on reddit, youtube, Netflix, mindlessly browsing looking for something to make me smile or laugh, just something bright in what became a daily experience of feeling depressed, sad, anxious, all the time. I would be on my phone or listening to music almost constantly. I would constantly be thinking about how I was missing work, letting down my family and friends. I didn’t want to open up to anyone. I was incredibly ashamed. I ended up failing two classes, attended my graduation since grades weren’t out yet, and just lied to family and friends. I told no one that I had failed, just held it inside. I moved back home with my parents, took an easy job where I figured I could take time to figure out what went wrong, and go back to finish my degree after a semester or two off. It’s been just about a year now since I failed, and I’m going back in the fall to finish. **Symptoms of Social Anxiety, How it Played Out in my Life** Once I moved back home, I took a job where I had infrequent social interaction, and I spent very little time with my family. Problems with social anxiety became worse than they had ever been. I would feel anxious when people walked up to me, I would feel anxious just doing something as simple as ordering coffee or walking through a grocery store. In conversations, I would try to make normal, comfortable eye contact, but lose track of what the other person was saying because my attention was on eye contact. I almost definitely came across as dumb or unfriendly. And that’s not me being too harsh on myself; I’ve spent most of my life friendly and pleasant to be around, I understand how I was coming across, I just couldn’t figure out how to be socially comfortable again. I was literally losing track of simple conversations, or my responses would become simple and short. This was very embarrassing for me. I became uncomfortable just being with other people, so I isolated myself more. Every day just kind of sucked, I was always worrying about how I came across to others, always worried in general. I became very depressed and lonely. Started smoking weed frequently, playing video games, watching movies, just looking for something good after a day of awkward interactions, of being judged, of feeling alone. Almost all of my friends from college lived far away, so I saw them very infrequently. **How I Got Rid of the Anxiety, Became Socially Comfortable Again** A big part of trying to get better was keeping track of how I was spending my time. I started writing an hour-by-hour log every day of what I was doing. Then at the end of the week, I’d review how the week had been, what areas I needed to focus on, what mistakes I kept making. At the end of the month, I’d do the same process. I started bringing a small notebook with me everywhere I went, and took down quick notes on any ideas or experiences that I wanted to be sure to remember later. I wrote in a journal, infrequently at first, then more regularly. I recommend doing something to keep track of life, it makes it easier to identify trends and progress. I stopped compulsively using my phone, and I cut back the time I was spending online, on reddit, watching youtube. All the time I would spend flicking my attention from link to link on reddit, always taking in content, never producing my own thoughts, was hurting my attention span. I found it harder to become engrossed in books and long form content than it was when I was younger. This was a real problem for me my senior year, and I am sure that my constant use of reddit and social media was a factor in my difficulty concentrating and getting work done. All that time on the internet was hurting my attention and putting my mind in an anxious state of staccato, quick thoughts. I am 100% sure that my overuse of the internet, reddit and youtube in particular, was having an adverse affect on my mind. It was taking the place of the natural human state of mind; longform, uninterrupted production and operation of thought. I started a habit of meditation every day. Essentially you sit quietly, and pay attention to sensations, emotions, and thoughts as they arise. I can’t overstate how important this has been to me. It is a peaceful 10 minutes at the start of the day, where I can relax, don’t have to worry about all the real problems that follow me around all day, and begin to understand the operation of my mind. I use the Waking Up app, highly recommend it, it is exceptionally well made. If you can’t afford the monthly subscription, like me, the creator Sam Harris offers a free yearly subscription, you just have to email the address in the app description, no questions asked. I started spending more time with people who I loved, who wouldn’t judge me. This is the most important part. I was always anxious to talk with people, because I wasn’t doing it very often. And when I did talk to people at work, they were strangers who didn’t know me, so if I came off as shifty or nervous they would pick up on that, and the interaction was often uncomfortable. My mind would then associate interaction with that unpleasant experience of being judged, of making people uncomfortable. Some of my good friends lived an hour or so away, but I knew I needed more social interaction, so I made the drive, over and over. After I spent an hour or so with my good friends, I started to feel relaxed, and was more able to get into the conversations, without thinking about eye contact, being self conscious about everything I said, etc. The key to feeling like my old social self was in large part this right here. SPEND MORE TIME WITH FRIENDS. I was lucky in that I had friends out there who loved me. I know some people don’t have anyone, and when you are awkward and anxious it is very hard to make those connections. Don’t give up. I started stretching and exercising every day. For me, anxiety and depression went hand in hand, and moving my body everyday had a huge impact on my depression. Obviously exercise alone won’t fix all your problems. For more information on depression I recommend the book “Lost Connections” by Johann Hari. It helped me a ton. Or for a quick runthrough of the book, listen to his interview on Joe Rogan or Sam Harris’ podcast. Exercise and stretching (look up beginner yoga routines on youtube to follow along with) helped me correct my posture. After going through four intense years of study, often sitting hunched over a desk, or looking down at my phone, or just lounging on the couch, living a sedentary lifestyle in general, my posture was becoming a serious problem. Mind and Body are fundamentally linked, so if you want to feel comfortable in mind, it helps to feel comfortable in your body. Start off slow if you need to, go for a short walk at least. Even on my worst days, getting out of the house and walking the dog helped a little. I started eating more healthy food. I switched to a regular diet of mostly eggs, meat, fish, vegetables, fruit. I figured stick to the foods that our species has evolved to consume. I’m not a nutrition expert, but eating like that, and getting enough to eat, meant I had a stable baseline of energy throughout the day, instead of being tired all the time. **Tips for Social Interaction** When I started spending more time with people, I was very rusty. I felt as if I had forgotten a bunch of the fundamentals. Here are a few things I find helpful to keep in mind. Eye Contact. I made so many mistakes when I was trying to get back to my normal social self, particularly around eye contact. Our species has evolved to convey and understand information through facial expressions and where we look. So it is important. Where you look says a lot. In general, when someone is talking to you, by looking at them you give the message “I am listening to you, I’m interested in what you’re saying, you are heard.” One mistake I was making was I would think “alright, be friendly, make eye contact”. But I would be so uncomfortable and unused to the experience, I would think about it too much, I would focus intensely on the eyes, and would be so focused on eye contact I wouldn’t even process what they said. So I’d give off a message that’s very off, too intense, and if I wasn’t listening to what was said I had to look away and kind of process after the fact. You basically want to get to a point where you aren’t thinking about eye contact. That’s only going to come from repeatedly going into social interactions, and eventually getting to aplace where it doesn’t make you uncomfortable, and you can just use your eyes to convey meaning. As a general rule, try and be relaxed, be friendly, and look at the person that’s talking to you. You don’t have to stare them down, just relax your gaze so you’re not pinpoint focused on only the eyes. You want your attention fully on what the person is saying to you, not on eye contact. You don’t have to force eye contact. If you aren’t too comfortable with it, that’s alright. As long as you pay full attention to what’s being said, you’re alright. If you come off a little shy because you’re not making a lot of eye contact, that’s ok. It gets easier the more time you spend with people. For an idea of where people generally look while in conversation, watch a youtube video of an interview with someone you respect or admire, and see what they do. Or just pay attention to how the people around you make eye contact. People tend to comfortably look at the other person while listening, and while speaking people tend to look away often while thinking, kind of checking in with their eyes every once in a while. There’s not one right way to do it, just do what is comfortable and effective for you. What to say. A lot of my anxiety around being with people was from not having much to talk about. Part of that was I was wasting so much time online, I really didn’t have many interests or recent experiences that were engaging to discuss. In any case, it’s always a good idea to try and talk in terms of the other person’s interests, if you want them to be engaged in the conversation. When you are just getting to know someone, ask questions about their life that you are curious about. Again, the more you do it the easier it gets. Ask about their life, what they do, what they like, what they dislike. Try and find out what they are really interested and passionate about. For example, if they keep bringing up Basketball, take note of that. Ask about their favorite team, did they play the sport in high school, whatever comes to mind. Or talk about whatever’s in the environment, or coming up at work or school. This post has gotten a bit too long, hope this helps someone out there, if you have any questions please post, I’ll respond when I can.",1
bn4clt,"run, outside","Im wasting my time. I just really need to vent this, my head is about to EXPLODE full of stress, but i just look at things and I worry why i cant be normal and cant dig myself out of loneliness. Just a heads up, its gonna be a long one if you are on mobile.  and#x200B; I wanna give some background, I live in the UK, sometimes I feel like this place is alien to me, even though for the 18 years ive been on this earth, ive lived here. I felt like i've never truly fitted with people, i dont think i'm an odd person, just my mental health is so poor, its comes off like that. Parents always called me a shy kid (I was quieter but i think i'm naturally a more chill person), I don't think that really helped my situation, because i wasn't suffering from it then, I remember still being able to be normal in public up until around the age of 13. I have faced a lot of bullying in my life, sometimes from my own family without them knowing it,up until the age of 16, maybe not to the extent of what other people have faced, but it seemed to affect me a lot more. I will say that anxiety does run in my family, so i believe it is partially down to genetics.  and#x200B; Right, I wanna cut deep into the bullying, I wanna start with my family, obviously i know families have a bit of it, its just natural, but I feel like they instilled fear into me for stuff that did not need it. For example, i still get anxiety from listening to certain types of music in my house incase someone hears it and says something about it, i remember one time, when i had my first phone (i had one before but my parents kept taking it off of me), there were music ringtones on there, i couldnt possibly remove them, they were system locked, my dad finds them one day on my phone, plays them and everyone in the house laughs at me. Or another example, which has hit me the hardest of them all, Social Media, they scared me into not getting, made me fear it cus i was too young for it, I might agree, but they made me avoid it like the plague, until 16, when I got facebook and Instagram finally (I had twitter at 13, buts its not really that kind of place, but I still cant bring myself to add my family on there let alone most people I know. In other forms of bullying, When i say i am not an odd person, well I definitely used to be, up until i started college, i was very weird, and was bullied to death in school, people would play 'punchies' on me just for fun, and well, me being a skinny kid, I couldnt really fight back with conviction. I admit, im an emotional guy, and that i ruined a lot of friendships for me, cus if one thing went wrong, id storm off, at least these days im able to battle off that emotion. I was made fun out of in every single way possible, and its beaten every single last ounce of confidence and self esteem I have had.  and#x200B; To put this into perspective, this is how bad my problems go to; I cant go outside without feeling a strong urge of anxiety, I cant add anyone on social media, even if I know them cus I dont trust anyone and im afraid they will also reject me, they have to add me, which of course, no one will because no one cares (honestly, i feel like i just really hate my area), so ive ended up with only like 30 friends on facebook, similar number on insta, I do have snap, but i think you dont really gotta add everyone on there, since its more of a private place. I feel really incompetent at doing anything by myself, i feel like i have to do stuff for a strong reason otherwise i flake. My anxiety out in public goes near panic attack levels, I wouldn't say i go to that, but I sometimes ill get a dry mouth and body just doesnt want to deal with the pressure, I also cant move my body normal unless i'm confident, which is a more weird quirk thats been given to me by social anxiety. I never had a girlfriend, never even had a first kiss, never even attempted to really chat up a girl, i feel like im gonna end up as one of those people who is in his mid 20s, and still in that situation. I dont even like people looking at my phone, I refuse to pull it out on public transport unless its pretty empty.  and#x200B; I feel so isolated all the time, my phone is constantly dry, I have tried some positive things, like meeting people online in various ways, a lot of those people I really like too. I've really tried to keep positive this week, but today its just went haywire, i woke up with a real big feeling of loneliness, i just felt the need to cry, I didn't know why, and now its just making me think about stuff too deeply.",1

I haven't been social at a healthy level for a couple years now (since maybe 14 years) and even then, I only had the one friend I depended on way too much. I haven't been able to go outside much. The thought scares me because I feel like I would look suspicious doing anything. I feel guilty all the time for things I haven't done. I feel like people hate me as soon as they see me. Which it doesn't help that I'm overweight. And I want to go outside and exercise to lose weight. I'd love to be able to get to a place (physically and mentay) where I can run because I love it so, so much and it helps with my emotions but I can only do it for a few short bursts. And I find it very hard to talk to anyone I don't know. I feel like I come off as cold and rude. I'm not meaning to, I really try to be nice to people but I think my expressions and tone don't match my intentions because people close to me say I look and sound angry and mean. But with family and their friends, it's difficult to talk because anything I say they kind of just stare and me and don't really respond to what I'm saying they just go back to what they were talking about before.

I started small like you should and just had the goal of saying hi to everyone i passed on my walks around my local park. From personal experience i can say that exposure therapy is probably the best thing you can do for yourself. I have a long way to go to I've also come a long way, all without professional help.

The first time I actively tried to make eye contact with a passer by on the street I physically felt my body resisting, like I'd decided to walk into the path of a moving car or something. But when nothing happened I instantly realised how normal it was and how capable I was of doing it. My advice would be to try things out on random strangers in passing as even if you mess up you know you'll never see that person again and whats more you get an endless amount of retries just by walking down the street. Treat it like a research experiment. Be willing to actively sacrifice your comfort zone for a few seconds just to see what happens. Then you can return to normal. ",1

It really helped me feel like I was active in society and you know it's keeping you fit so you don't feel like such a waste of space all the time. Plus the endorphins you get will help uplift your mood and temporarily increase your confidence. It's a great way to feel like you're doing something without really doing anything. ",1

Read a book, listen to music, do whatever you feel like. It's kind of weird, but just repeating to myself 'This is normal behavior' while sitting in public and drinking coffee really helps.

I love being there for people and being able to make their day better. I have some inner turmoil over whether or not I am actually a good person or if I just delude myself into thinking I am. I get worried that I only help people to make me seem like a better person to myself, to justify thinking that I am one. I try to be fair and kind to everyone, but what if I am only fooling myself? I have met people in my life that just seemed so fake. Yes, they seemed nice, but you could see through it as an act, that they were just humoring the situation. I am scared I am one of these people except everyone but me can see who I really am. I am basically friendless. I have one good friend who has an SO and a kid with another on the way, and then couple people that I meet to have drinks with. I am a mess about this. I try my best to be a good person, but if I were one, wouldn't I have people that cared about me like I do them? Anyone I reach out to ignores me. I can't figure out why. Am I obnoxious? Am I so boring? Do I really contribute nothing worthwhile enough to have people want me around? I like to learn things. I like discussion. I like to share nice things I think about people. I will admit when I am wrong. I try to make everyone have an enjoyable time doing whatever we are doing. I have really bad anxiety. Sometimes this doesn't allow me to be myself, so I seem really shut off/ bored/or boring. But it is only sometimes, and to make it worse it usually happens when someone does finally get back in touch with me after I asked to hangout. I think, ""Oh man, they want to hangout? No one wants to hang out with me. If they do they will just end up regretting it since everyone else does. Or, if it goes well I will just ruin the friendship another time."" I have gotten better at hiding it, I think, though. I think I am fun. I like who I am. I am always open to bettering myself. I wish people could just be honest in what they think of me. I have seen someone distancing themselves from me (it is a common enough occurrence) and have intentionally pried into their reasons as to why, full well knowing it would be a faux pas, only to get transparent pleasantries and excuses. Which is reasonable if I put someone that is trying not to be close to me in a intimate spot. I didn't care that I was vulnerable. I just want to fix myself. I have never cared to be popular, or be in the spotlight. The small moments I have been, it is nice, but it is not something I seek at all. I just want people I meet/know to walk away thinking I was nice to talk to. That they had a good time sharing my company. It would be even nicer if I could have taught them something, or them pleased after I told them they taught me something. As much as I want those things, I cannot allow myself not to be me, though. I am very honest. I will not lie about anything, and the times I am forced to (socially, for some situation I cannot explain otherwise) you can see through the discomfort on my face. I have been called blunt, but I try to be tactful at all times. This leads to me brushing people the wrong way sometimes. But I cannot think of a time where the people upset by this trait were people I cared for. As I said, I will willingly admit that I am wrong. I think it is really important for people to admit that they are. You cannot know everything. Not being able to admit you don't makes you fail as a human. People I remember writing me off as an asshole are people that don't share this sentiment. For nearly a year I have been depressed about this. I broke up with one of the best people that has ever been in my life because I felt I wasn't good enough/just would keep her down. I lost a group of friends when I started dating her because my ex was the out-going hub of the entire friend group. So, me being around made my ex sad (I am not sure of better word) and the times both my gf and I went to a gathering it made my ex very uncomfortable. So I stopped getting invites to things.. then I stopped getting responses when I would try to plan something. This made me depressed, that either my friends didn't like me, or they liked someone who they know treats people poorly better than me because she was more fun. For a couple months after that I tried reaching out to people and no one cared to talk to me. At this point it was hurting my relationship with my gf. I started to feel bad that I couldn't be the person she fell for. I was too depressed to be me. And the days I felt like myself I still would get pangs of chest pain because I knew that she should have someone that society felt contributed. (She convinced me to quit my terrible job because she thought that was what was destroying me. Which, it was, but not all like she thought. This was also good advice from her point of view because I had a LOT in savings from doing nothing but working at this job. So leaving to find a job to better my happiness was a good thing to do.) I was jobless and friendless and the fact that she wanted me, as twisted and sick as it is, made me I stop loving her. She deserved someone better, so I made that choice for her. I wanted to be better. I wanted to be someone she deserved. So I started trying to be a person. I went and got a real hairstyle (I use to just use clippers and do it myself.) I started running/biking again. (I have chronic hip pain from my old job, so it made me lose my favorite thing to do.) I got over my anxiety of going to a gym and signed up for one. I went an bought a new wardrobe because she always dressed so nice and I just wore running/work out attire. I enrolled in school, which is something I stopped when I went full-time at my job that had mandatory over time 2-3 hours a day. In school I started strong, I was ahead of everything, getting close with my professors and the head of the department so I could get connections for an internship. Then my anxiety hit me, hard. I couldn't finish my resume because I am a 25 year old with nothing worthwhile to say on paper. I lost the internship prospects, hurt my relations with my professors. That caused depression, my grades started to slip towards the end of the semester. My 4 A's fell to near F's and I was lucky enough to find some willpower thanks to a nice classmate I knew from an old job and rounded my grades to C's before the end. Even though things went well for awhile, it didn't matter. Nothing changed. No one cared. I ended things last November with her. I was motivated to better myself until April. I went to the Gym every other day, I ate healthy, I wasn't excited to be back in school, but I did it and took pride in doing so. But the pride in myself diminished to nothing. I still had no one to go have fun with. No one texted how I was doing. I even stopped getting likes/conversations on Tinder, which was my last resort for a quick pick me up. I am lonelier more than ever, and I have been without close people most of my life. I use to get on cams to flirt/make fleeting friends before. Or teach people English (which is something that brought me joy.) Now the only connection I feel with people throughout the day are the 5 or so upvotes I get on something. I use to be a lurker and only send messages when I saw people hurting or if they seemed like they were remarkable genuine people for something they said. I would just tell them I would be here to listen for the former case and that I appreciate them if it were the latter. I use to get conversations from those, but now nothing. It is as if the world is intentionally turning its back on me. Since April I have basically laid in bed. I still go run/bike and work out at home, but it is a fight with myself to do that. I browse reddit, read books, masturbate, play league, or just lay in bed and scream in my head about what is wrong with me. I don't know if anyone knows how truly unhappy I am. I don't know if they know about my situation and feel awkward/helpless about it, so they ignore it, or if I am really fooling people. I don't want to be a burden so I don't talk about anything. When my brother's girlfriend asked why I wasn't leaving for classes I told her I missed the deadline to enroll because I was depressed a friend of mine passed away. Really though, we were no longer friends because she was part of that old group. I would have loved to be friends with her. She was one of the very few people that genuinely seemed to be happy to see me the entire year. I was especially torn up about losing someone that I use to call friend, and one that genuinely seemed to care about me (she cared about everyone. She was an amazing person) but even had that horrible thing not happened, I wouldn't have gotten out of my bed. Why couldn't the world have taken me instead? I can't find any strength in myself. I don't know what to do. ",1

67qdas,stream," Vent about having a crush and various other incoherent sentences. So there is this girl I ""volunteer"" with, we see each other maybe once a day, hardly ever talk except for the occasional greetings. Anyways, I have a mad crush on her. I think so, anyways. I feel like there's no way I could know what love is if I've never been in a relationship with anyone. But that's beside the point. She's only the third, maybe second, not sure, person I have had a crush on even though I'm already 20 years of age. She is absolutely gorgeous and funny and smart and I really want to get to know her but as you might already guess, there's this gnarly thing called social anxiety. Now I think usually SA doesn't hit me particularly hard. I can go outside, I go to work everyday without feeling overly anxious, hell, I plan on going on vacation alone to a far away country soon. But the environment I get stupidly anxious in is when around ""peers"", people roughly my age. I feel like I don't fit in because I don't partake in the same activities as they do (like drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes or pot, ""socialising""), or because I simply don't consider myself interesting. I mean I've got a few hobbies like listening to music or travelling (well, usually it's mostly thinking about travelling, shit's expensive), but I feel like people might not care about those things enough, I don't know. Just as I am writing these passages (rewriting, over and over and over...) I realise how groundless my ""thoughts"" about this are. Of course one can have a great conversation (theoretically anyways, I seemingly can't, I feel like I'm shit at keeping conversations alive, probably due to lack of practice) with an absolute stranger about these topics, I mean why not? Many, many people travel, even more so people my age, and I can't imagine anyone who **doesn't** listen to music. Anyways, whenever I do end up in a conversation with others my age I end up just being in the background, listening to what they say, not contributing anything beyond laughing at their jokes. And if I don't already feel stupid during those situations, I **will** feel stupid afterwards because I'll think the others will think of me as weird, ""remember that guy, why didn't he say anything"", ""why does he laugh so weirdly"", ""why does he keep looking at the floor"". The few times I did manage to break out of my shell I ended up dwelling on what people would think of me nonetheless, or I feel like I embarrassed myself due to the shit I ended up saying. Which is why I end up keeping to myself most of the time, I'm afraid of the stupid stuff I would otherwise end up saying. I feel like I'm a nuisance to people, even when they invited me to gatherings, because they could obviously do without this weirdo in the background who giggles occasionally and is otherwise dead silent. (Note: I hate how my rants always end up like an convoluted stream of consciousness.) So on monday I had to do this small thing at work, she basically had to do the second shift. When she arrived, I greeted her and basically fled the scene. I wish I would have maybe stuck around and had a chat, although even to this day I honestly can't think of anyway I could have pulled it off without looking weird. On the second day she arrived and I sort of ended up asking her if she needed help, which she said yes to, so I did because I had plenty of time on my hands. We actually ended up joking around a bit, which I loved, but we were otherwise largely busy so no time for chit-chat. She wasn't there today but she actually wrote me a message (holy shit yes) asking if I wanted to help her out for the next two days too. Of course I said yes! There were situations before where I might have had an opportunity to get to know her more but I always blew them by overthinking things and being too shy. I'm afraid I'll blow this perhaps final chance with no one to blame but myself. I feel like there have been signs she might like-like me too, and othertimes I feel like she tolerates me at best. And the thing about her is, she seems to be shy at first too. Which I absolutely adore, however it hardly makes it easier for us to get to know eachother. Man, in situations like these I sometimes wish I could just go back to the apathetic depressed self from a few months ago instead of being this hopelessly lovesick and still-sometimes-sorta-depressed weirdo.

8v2smz,"mountain, biking, outside "," What should I do about my appearance and anxiety. I am 20 year old virgin male who has never been in a relationship, I'm not really sure if I am ugly but my brothers lightly drunk friend have said so and is the reason I have no success with women. This coupled with social anxiety has lead to me being isolated from my peers at uni and resulting in no social life. Overall I'm not fat by any means, I regularly go mountain biking and this has kept me in a really good physical condition. moreover, I have a good well paying job lined up as a civil engineer when I complete my last few semesters at uni. However, I am immensely afraid of leaving leaving university, as it is my only means of potential social interaction with girls. I know when I start working as a civil engineer I will be unable to socialize outside of work as I am terribly afraid of going out (bad experience at nightclub when previously mentioned brothers friend and some others essentially made me go to a nightclub, I just sat down on a stool for 3 hours feeling pathetic and useless than I ever have). Taking this into account I am fairly certain after uni I would have lost all chances of meeting a girl. Overall I am very concerned that I will simply die alone as a virgin, resulting in me feeling depressed and having almost daily suicidal thoughts (when I'm sitting in lectures alone as always I just think about ending my life and how to do it becauae life is too difficult and most likely will get much worse). I am not sure what to do, I have tried socializing but I stutter, I even help people with math and physics just so I can talk to them but nothing changes, everyone avoids me and I feel immensely isolated from the world , like I don't fit in (became very apparent at uni and nightclub) and should just die.

dhoteuf,walk, Work on your diet and fasted cardio is the best way to lose weight. Wake up early in morning eat nothing and run a mile and drink water. Later in the day do more fasted cardio before dinner. Do that everyday+great diet you will lose your weight. You'll have to lose the water weight first then you'll see a decrease of body fat overall and don't worry about the scale worry about consistency. If you can run a mile work up to it start walking. You can also lose a lot of weight from gym and lifting weights but cardio is better but since your in this subreddit da gym is scary. I know a lot about fitness I'm just turned 17 a go to a small gym that just opened :D nobody goes lol Any other question I can try to help I can also give you some recourses if you want I'll just have to find them ,1
dyxuvb1,"snowboard, beach, skate, skate,  parks","We accepted the fact that it was weird to meet at first so we put it behind us and were just normal friends as if we were online. My good online friends (3) all live in a house together so it was cool to visit them all at once. They live in vegas so they showed me around and there was a lot to do. The whole reason for the visit was to go snowboarding for 2 days up at Mount Charleston. Was SUPER fun. The drive to vegas was 6 hours there then 6 back.. 12 HOURS ALONE haha. Few months later they visited me in San Diego and we went around town and what not; beach, food, etc A year later i re-visited them and we went and skateboarded at a bunch of different skate parks and went around las vegas. Another fun trip. I'm a bit closer to one of them so he came down to SD for a Greenday concert adn we had dennys. To sum it up it wasnt awkward meeting at first. Its really no different than online",1

g3yo7mo,"ocean, outside , wildlife , outside "," The aquarium building is closed for now so they set up displays outside. It's right by the ocean so it was really nice being outside the whole time. Anyway as far as animal fields, I guess that depends on if you want to do something like animal husbandry (with pets, farm animals, or wild animals) or be involved with a more wildlife restoration or management side. Not many places are open for volunteers right now, I just got lucky finding the aquarium by me that was. But otherwise I'd be trying to do stuff like trail cleanups. Not sure but there might be animal sanctuaries or shelters who need volunteers. I think I found the aquarium through volunteermatch. They weren't having volunteers for a bit but they kept my app on file, they only just recently reopened as an outside only thing. A great resouce for career stuff in the wildlife biology field is Kristina Lynn on youtube, she made me realize that that's my true dream job. She keeps it real and does ""day in my life as a wildlife biologist"" kind of videos too which is helpful to see what the job is actually like. Highly recommend her videos. :) ",1
o40zfa,"camping, beach, hiking, swimming, camping, beach,  camp, beach"," Anyone Have Seemingly Random Moments Free From Social Anxiety?. I'm very socially anxious and introverted; I generally don't interact with people or try to make friends, etc. I'll give you an example of one such instance where I seemed to magically change. I went camping by myself at a site near a beach. I enjoyed being by myself, hiking out and swimming, etc. But I was feeling slightly lonely. Two girls who were camping near me came down to the beach and like a total coward I just kept my distance and didn't say anything to them. I barely greeted them when they said ""Hi"" as I passed their camp. I was pretty brief and shy with any other campers I came across as well. Later, I decided to start making a beach fire, when another guy my age came up and asked to help and started talking and joking with me. I was kind of shocked since nobody ever just approaches me in a friendly manner like that. We built a huge fire together and hung out the rest of the night drinking and talking about deep stuff like we had been good friends for a while. Maybe it was the fact that he approached me (I don't think I would've approached him) but it was so out of character for me to be so talkative and friendly with a complete stranger. Nothing like it has happened since. I wish I could recreate that scenario in my daily life and be friendly and gregarious with everyone, but the majority of the time, I'm so far from that state mentally. ",1
k820y7,barbecue," Hey, stupid. Get out of your head!. For real. Spending so much time *thinking* and being inside my own head is probably the biggest reason i have social anxiety. I'm training myself to stop this. And it's actually not that hard. Get your head up. Have a look around you. Pay attention to the people, the things, the smell and the sounds of the world you're in. It can help you see things for what they really are. I was in a family barbecue today, and instead of worrying about what to do or what to say, i just enjoyed the hell out of it. ",1
mjiv5b,bicycle," Got so fucking lonely that i ended up going outside. People say that if they gave in to their anxiety they would never go out again. Well, today i learned that that ain't true. After days without leaving my place and seeing other people, i just reached my limit today. I started feeling desperate for human contact. I went out, visited some relatives of mine, rode my bicycle around the neighborhood and it felt great, even though i was still anxious.

e2tyj2c,Go for a walk,"Relax, always remember to breathe. It's very, very, very unlikely that things will be as bad as you think. Try reading a book, listening to music or whatever it is you like doing to relax, maybe go for a walk. Exercise tends to help clear the mind. Also, make sure to eat right and sleep enough. Your mental state is closely linked to your physical health, so if you don't take care of yourself you're only going to feel worse. Lack of sleep especially can really make you oversensitive. ",1
ey0wuie,Go for a walk,"If you think it's because you're not used to the situation, then the obvious thing to do would be to go for it anyway and try to get used to the environment. (Easier said than done, of course.) You don't have to go all out immediately, of course, but maybe doing smaller, low pressure things with a friend could help you acclimatize better. Go for a walk, run errands, play a game at home or wherever you're comfortable, that sort of thing. nnI would also recommend looking up a few breathing exercises, as focusing on something else can often help with nervousness. You could also try telling someone you trust about your problem, so they can help you calm down when you feel nervous or nauseated again. You might be having overstimulation/hypersensitivity issues, so taking an occasional breather while out being social might be all you need. nnThat said, I'm no professional. If this keeps up, you'll want to see a therapist or similar who's better suited to help you overcome anxiety. You can't just keep avoiding people forever, after all. Well, you could, but that's no way to live.",1
