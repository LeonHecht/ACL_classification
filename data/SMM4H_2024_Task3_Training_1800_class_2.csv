3nmtlt,park,"I asked a girl out for the first time today!. I turned 22 today, and decided it was finally time to just go for it and ask somebody out, since I've never even tried before. My therapist has been telling me that I need to work on getting over my fear of rejection, and to try asking out random girls with the goal of getting rejected. So I went up to a cute girl in a park, started chit-chatting, and just as I was leaving I asked if she wanted to go on a date with me. My hands were shaking so bad and I could barely speak, but I got her number and we're going out this week!",2
3pbufk,"walk, outside","Where does your SA stem from?. **I realize most people with SA probably don't know the answer to this question, or they know wrong one. Obviously peoples' anxieties have different backgrounds and triggers. I want to know what yours is, I'll tell what mine is and the fact that I think this the most common one. Mine's self-worth, and that includes physical appearance in a major way. Just recently I started talking (and literally haven't stopped since then other than when we're asleep) to a girl I've liked for a year who has also basically liked me for the same amount of period (yeah guess what, me being fucking borderline autistic made it so that although we both liked each other and basically both *knew* that we liked each each other it still took a year) and my general social anxiety is practically gone. It's absolutely still there for majorly uncomfortable situations, but stuff like interaction with regular people, my peers, walking around outside without being bothered by others looking at you is gone. And I think that the number one reason for that is because I now realize that I am, or I can be desirable to some people. The girl I'm talking to, if leagues exist, I'd be in league 1 and she'd be fucking infinity and yet we're practically together. I know this post comes off as sorta braggy (which might have even been my subconscious goal) but I really think we have to seek out that one person who really cares about us to realize how much others might (potentially) care about us. Please share what you think where your SA *really* lies.",2
3pq1i1,"walk, camps","Sharing my experience of Social Anxiety for the first time.. Hi, before I begin talking about my social anxiety, I would just like to say that this is not my usual account, I created this because I feel that it would hinder my ability to properly express myself if I use my personal account. Sorry if this infringes on any of the rules, I am not totally familiar with them. You can take this down if you want or let me know and I will fix/take it down for you. Im 18 years old, male and I believe that I have some form of social anxiety and I want to share how it has so far affected my life. I recently started university in the UK and I am in a flat of 13 other people. My earliest memory, and I believe one of the causes of my social anxiety was Christmas day when I was about 6 or 7. My Uncle came to our house for the first time (he lived in another country) and he brought a camcorder. He filmed us opening our presents and I was so excited I always wanted to be on camera and see myself on the TV. When I heard my voice on the TV aged 6, I wanted it turned off immediately. I try never to speak on camera even now. I have usually found it really really hard to make new friends. If I make one, I latch on to him as much as possible and usually divert any conversations to them if someone I know tries to initiate a conversation with me. Im currently at 6 weeks into university and I haven’t made any friends, which is my fault because I don’t initiate any conversations and any conversations that I do have last around 6 seconds because I don’t know what to say to people. Its usually, goes “Hi, (insert name here)” - Other person “Hi (insert name here)” – Me “How are you?” – Other person “Good, you?” – Me “Im good” – Other person “That’s good” – Me (Awkward pause and I walk off to avoid further embarrassment) I promised myself that on the first day I moved in I would introduce myself to everyone but when I walked in, they said hi and I got really hot and flustered and couldn’t. I rarely leave my room, only to go to lectures and seminars (which I worry about hours beforehand) and I often go days without eating proper food because people are currently in the kitchen. At School it was a little bit of a benefit because while people would take time in their work to talk, I would out of awkwardness, concentrate fully on my work. Now at university, they suggest that you join or form a study group with your friends, which is hard because Im on the other side of the country and I have no friends here. I am really worried how I will communicate with others when we have to start giving group presentations and working in groups. We haven’t even been assigned one yet and it already takes up hours of worry in my mind. I am worried because I want to be successful at whatever it is that I am doing but I cant properly talk to people and I know that this will be a huge hindrance. I have never approached someone of the opposite gender and talked to them, I don’t know what to say. I only have one friend who is a girl and its more a friendship of association because she is my friends girlfriends. One of the feelings that I get when I am around people is a feeling of inferiority. I am 5 foot 5, which is small for a male, and have always been the smallest in my class. I have been mistaken for up to 6 years younger than I am and I think this is one of the causes of it. I cant just talk to someone for the sake of it I have to have a reason otherwise I would be wasting their time. If someone else initiates a conversation with one of my friends or vice versa I stand there really really awkwardly. I cant wait in queues with a whole bunch of people because I feel like I am holding them up. If I am waiting to go into a lecture, I wait towards the back of the group because I don’t want to add to their displeasure of waiting. Its almost as if, subconsciously, that my presence offends people. Not that I think that I am in any way important, quite opposite, I feel like a nobody. If there was anything important that I needed to ask someone about that I didn’t know from school, I would do it on facebook, and even then it would take a few hours to come up with what I saw as the right way to frame this. Even for this post, I have to keep reminding myself that it is anonymous. My parents don’t know how seriously it affects me. They think Im shy and often when I was younger they would get cross because I wouldn’t socially interact with other people for summer camps, for example. Anyway, the purpose of this post was to share my experience with social anxiety and at least get a little bit of the pressure off my chest. Having not talked so freely in my entire life it feels that I have had a little bit of word vomit. I tried to make this post as coherent as possible Thanks for taking the time to read this.",2
3r4tzb,"walk, outside"," While in bed, do you sometimes get pumped to solve your problems but when you wake up all that willpower is all lost?. It can also happen while I'm scrolling through Facebook. I get the willpower to go on a diet and to take a walk outside but after a while I go back to being depressed in front of my computer. This bugs me so bad. ",2
41r3as,"outside, lawn, horse","I have no idea.... This is most likely going to be long, and pretty scattered. I'll keep details to a minimum for the sake of saving time. My 'issues' started when I was 15, as far as I know. Right before my birthday I had gone through what I would consider to be a traumatic experience. And so began the slow and dreadful downhill spiral into complete nothingness. First I was just homeschooled. Then I lost all contact with supposed friends. Then the outside world completely. At this point I was still functional enough to mow the lawn and go to basic places like doctors, dentists, grocery stores, etc. Those eventually all stopped and I isolated myself, pretty much professionally if I do say so myself. After a while of kind of enjoying being alone I started not enjoying it so much. I found myself daydreaming of having friends and those memorable moments that don't take place on your mom's couch. And after not too long of that, I started feeling like I would die without it. But I didn't know how to talk to people anymore. What to say, how to act, what to do. In just a few short years I forgot how to be a human. I still have no fucking clue of what to do in social situations. But, and now fast forward to the present. I don't like people anymore and now those 'dreams' of having friends have turned into full blown nightmares of having (keyword having) to do stuff eventually. I can't just hide from the world my entire life no matter what 'reasons' I have. It's confusing though. I never maintain the same perspective for more than a few days. Some days I wake up feeling lonely, and praying for someone to text me. Others, I wake up not even being able to stand my little siblings saying good morning to me. On top of that, there's not voices, but there's definitely two different versions of my voice in my head. I'll attempt to provide at least a decent example. Version #1, I feel like I have a 2 foot dick just blowing it in the wind as I sit comfortably in my high horse and look down on all the peasants. Version #2, I feel like I have a 2 inch soggy day old breadstick from Little Caesar's say between my legs and I'm nothing more than the scum of the earth. (The dick metaphors are the best representation of one's ego I could think of. Just go with it. Pls.) Then there's the personality aspect of it. There's day where I talk to people on Skype and I couldn't be happier. I enjoy the shit out of myself and act like an idiot just for a good laugh. Then there's days where I wish I could hit the lottery. Just to hire a group of Russian mercenaries to kill all the stupid people that annoy me. The worst part, I'm not even talking about genuinely annoying. I'm talking about my version. Example, someone asking me a question that I feel is pointless, makes my head ring, and I go back to the thought of hiring mercenaries. I can't really explain this part well, but I feel like people do shit on purpose. There's NO way the general public is so stupid, and annoying that I actually pray for mass genocide on a daily basis. It just seems like something that can't be true. Right? And for me to have such a passionate hatred towards people in general when not everyone has ever done anything to me. I don't know. This is getting to the point where now I'm confusing myself, so...",2
444a2b,"garden, outside"," Out of the frying pan.... And okay for the moment. I had a ""job"" for several months (my first job), and I only held on for so long because I always felt my mother leaning over me with a gun to my head. I didn't know what she would do and it frightened me, so I kept on pretending to work being too scared to do anything that required interacting with someone else. I had some serious panic, anxiety, depression, all the good stuff. Now we've all moved and my mother is allowing me to work around the house tending to the garden and stuff and everything is simmering down for me. I'm starting to feel okay, like, you know, sane. I have some understanding of my own surroundings and life doesn't feel like one big long nightmare anymore. I just wanted to share, even if no one reads this, how much I appreciate being able to rest, away from other people (I pretty much haven't spoken to anyone outside of my family since a week before thanksgiving). It's therapeutic. ",2
4atu7q,"walk, park, tree, run","I was just assaulted by a gang of teens. :/ So, I was walking in the park and I saw a gang of about 15 teens maybe 13 years old or so. I'm always aware of everyone because of my anxiety so I did have thoughts about how maybe they would do something to me, but I have that thought every time I see a gang of young people (I'm only 24 myself) so I dismissed it like I always do. I just walked past them, a bit nervous but overall calm and not expecting anything to happen. Out of nowhere some kid slams into me from behind, I actually thought a tree branch had fallen on me or something at first. I was facing the other way so I didn't really see what he did but it was like he slammed his whole body into me or something. Just totally unprovoked. I pretty much blend in, there's literally nothing about my appearance or demeanour that would offend or piss someone off but they apparently decided I was a good target. I almost fell over and at first I was so shocked that I didn't say anything as they walked away (just walked, didn't even try to run) and my anxiety kicked in and I thought ""just don't say anything"" but then about 10 seconds pass and I decided to shout at them. The time elapsed probably gave off signals that I'm not very assertive, plus my anxiety was probably evident so they just laughed at me and ran off. I continued walking, feeling pretty shit about myself. I sat down in my usual spot and I tried to relax but I couldn't. I felt really anxious and shaky. I'm a pretty sensitive guy anyway, but this is something I've never experienced before and I kept playing over in my head how lame I sounded when I shouted at them and I actually felt like crying. While I was sitting under a tree, feeling terrible and trying not to cry in public I saw them come back over to me and one of them threw a rock at me. It didn't hit me, but it freaked me out. Then before I could say anything, they started throwing rocks at windows, trying to break them. Seeing them again actually made me feel calm, my anxiety lifted. I was really nervous about passing them again to leave the park, but then when I saw them I realised they were just a bunch of idiot kids and I felt alright. Anyway, I called the police and they picked me up in a van and we drove around the neighbourhood trying to find them but couldn't so they drove me home. I was hoping we'd catch them, because even though that would mean I would have had to face them again, I kind of wanted them to realise I wasn't some push over who just allows kids to assault me. I wanted to talk to them again and teach them a lesson. But overall it worked out fine, so I'm happy about that. I tried my best and I feel good now, as opposed to anxious and shaky. I see lots of people asking here if you can overcome social anxiety and I'm not sure if you can get rid of it completely - maybe - but I do know that it can be massively improved. I used to be agoraphobic, I was afraid to leave the house because of the people I'd have to encounter. Now I can leave the house and do things that I never thought I'd be able to do. 5 years ago I couldn't even pick up a telephone and now I can deal with high-stress situations like this without completely breaking down. I definitely could have handled it better, but I did my best and hopefully stuff like this will make me more socially hardy. It's totally possible to improve guys. :)",2
4azdf3,"garden, outside","""You should be out there enjoying your life"". So I was happily working on my garden (I was preparing a bumblebee hive), enjoying the sunny day. And out of nowhere this scumbag neighbour of mine appears, staring at me through the fence. Don't know for how long was he standing there. I say 'hi' and he just replies: 'Man you should go out there and enjoy life while you're young' and goes away. Made me so angry, why the fuck can't people give me a break even when I'm on MY garden?? Yes I know at 23 yrs I should be out nonstop partying, getting wasted and having casual sex 24/7. So now I can't catch a break even when I'm right outside of my home. Damn I should build a concrete wall around the house. Sorry for the rant, I just needed to write it out. :(",2
4dp832,"walk, outside","I did it! I got my hair cut!. Im going to apologize in advance and just say that I often give too many details in my stories making them very long but that's just how I do it. I like to explain everything. My thought process what I was thinking and feeling.. A few days ago I realised that my hair had gotten pretty long. It had been around 3 months since my last haircut. I know it was before December 24 2015. For a few hours last night before I went to bed I was trying to look up places I could get my hair cut. The price and how long it would take to walk. Every time I've had my hair cut and the hairdresser asks how to cut it I just stutter a ""err idk just shorter. Do what you want"" and in a thread I've made before about getting my hair cut people were suggesting that I show a picture of what I want done. So I looked up pictures of myself on phone and narrowed it down to 3 pictures I believe were taken a week or two after I had my hair cut. ""This looks short enough. I'll just show them this"". The whole day leading up to me entering the door to the haircutter I was thinking ""should I go. Should I just do it another day"" but each step I took (eating breakfast, getting dressed, going outside) that got me closer to the haircutter the more forced I felt to actually go through with it. I tried to think less and just do it. The place is a rather small place and you can't even pay with a card, only cash (as I found out) and the guy who cut my hair didn't speak the language very well. When I went in there were 2 employees and the boss. All being with a customer and cutting their hair so I sit down and wait. Usually the place is pretty full (as I said it's a pretty small room) and I was worried about looking like a fool in front of other customers trying to ask if they had time for a drop-in customer. A lot of people who go there seems to be friends with the owner too or know them very well which makes it feel worse. Like if the owner is just a complete stranger to them then we have something in common. I sit there for a couple of minutes and the owner (who's cutting someone's hair) makes eye contact with me like he's wondering what I'm doing. Making me feel anxious ish. A guy walks in, he clearly knows the owner, after a bit he asks how long until he's free. Owner says 5m and the guy goes outside to smoke or whatever. So there I am, just sitting there awkwardly, wondering if I should be asking if they have time for a drop in or something. Or do I just wait here until one of them is done cutting and stands behind the register?? Ofc i chose to sit there like a socially awkward dude. Once the owner is done with his customer he starts to get ready to go outside for a smoke break. I didn't stand up or talk to him I just sat awkwardly. I felt like I had missed an opportunity. But a minute or so after that the other guy was done cutting his customers hair too and I asked him if he has time for a drop in and he said yes. And here's the best part. Remember, this is the very first time I was going to show the haircutter a picture of how I want mine cut, so I had rehearsed it a million times in my head already. Show picture, say I want something like that, sit down. I awkwardly say ""is. . I brought a picture"" I pull up my phone which has the picture already loaded. ""Something like this?"" He takes the phone and asks ""do this?"" I'm like ..yeah do that. Like that. A few moments of silence after I sit down, he seems hesitant to cut it like that. ""Like that or.. better"" NO YOU'RE DEVIATING FROM THE SCRIPT. ""Ehh heh better I guess if you can"" are the words that leave my mouth. He says ""this picture.. not very good. Not that good looking hair"" I'm like well shit I spent like 10 minutes anxious over which picture to use and it's not a great pic I agree but it's fine. It's short. I just want it shorter. So I say ""heh yeah do better if you can then. If you want"". ""I can do better"" he says and starts cutting. Once he's done he says something and I was like huh what did you say? I asked that maybe 2 to 3 times during that whole visit. I felt like such an incompetent ass. Oh remember how I didn't know it was a cash only place? He said nope sorry can't pay with card here. And I'm like oh god.. ""where can I find an atm.."" he says around the corner ""you know where?"" I Say no and he gestures again around the corner. So I go around the corner but see no atm I ask 2 women passing by where the nearest atm is and it's a biiit further away. Around another corner. I feel like the haircutter might think I'm not gonna pay so I had intentionally left my jacket behind. Had to stand in line for the atm (lady took god same forever) and I was thinking about how long it was taking me to get back so I could frikken pay him. Anyway I finally had it done. Usually my dad drives me to some place and comes with me (since he has to wait for me anyway) which makes me feel like shit and like a child. I'm 22. It looks good now I think and I rode the high of "" I did something today "" for a few hours after that. If you actually read everything then I'm sorry haha. I should learn how to be more concise but I just feel like I want to convey every detail possible. As if the person listening to my story was there. That's why I like pictures. Shows what it actually is like instead of them having to imagine it. Maybe it just looks like a lot cus I'm on my phone. It's still a lot.",2
4e7g6w,garden,"being sober at a party is literally my worst nightmare. i had a really shitty time at a party last week and its been making me feel like crap for a while so i thought id take the chance to get it off my chest. Basically, i got invited to a house party of someone i never really hang out with, which was a pleasant surprise, but at the same time it made it even more intimidating as it wasnt really my crowd. Thankfully though, 5 close friends of mine were also invited (like 60 people there in total) so i had the courage to show up. To drown out my anxiety at parties, i tend to drink lots of alcohol (pretty common among 16 year olds to get completely smashed at parties) but the problems tend to come later on in the night when i sober up. By the time i sobered up at around 11, i suddenly started becoming anxious and self conscious, and just felt like complete shit. I slipped out of the house into the garden and hid round the side of the house where no one could see me and waited it out on my own until my brother could pick me up. Anyways, the next day i go onto my phone and see pictures on instagram of my friends having the night of their lives. And for some reason, every time i look at them, i just get this feeling of regret and sadness that everyone else seemed to be enjoying themselves while i was shutting myself off and hiding away from everyone feeling miserable. So yeah, dont mind me, just thought id get it off my chest. Anyone else here get terrified of people at parties?",2
4f3m8j,outside,"I am so bad at interacting again..... Feels like I have no friends :(.. I've been already suffering from social anxiety since ever I was bullied in my school 5 years ago. Few months ago I was getting finally better and better after being anxious for years.. Now since at least February or March, everything became as bad as before, almost everyone I know are ignoring me because I am too boring due of my anxiety. Some even bullied me about it. I am just literally forced to stay and be alone all the time. Recently, it got way too far that I feel too bad/depressed about my inability to talk with people and that I am alone all the time, makes me sometimes suicidal as hell. I don't know why almost everyone ignores me when I am a purely good person. I just sometimes can't find what to talk about, especially with my girl friends and only saying hi to them only makes them think I'm boring and I am not really worth to talk with. I almost never got invited to hang around outside or to birthday parties in my life, all I do is sit at home infront of my computer all day. Although, I've finally hanged outside 3 weeks ago with 2 of my new friends, started to be a bit boring to them, just like with others :(. All of my classmates don't care even slightly about me and pretend as if I don't exist at all. To be honest, my biggest dream is that I would finally wake up socially active, not anxious, many good friends to talk for a long time, hang around together, don't get ignored by about everyone. I don't know what to do about myself, I am so inconsistent in socializing and it makes me feel very bad about myself, lonely, friendless, depressed and suicidal. I tried everything, and today I didn't talk with anyone :(",2
4kv87e,"outside, walk, runs, running","I can't be alone. So here it goes.... I'm a 20 yo male from the US. I have been consciously struggling with social anxiety for about 3 years now. I really don't know where to start because my anxiety spreads across many categories. The most prominent and most harmful,though, is my fear of rejection. I am constantly dwelling on my peers' apparent perception of me. After every action I make, whether it be getting out of my chair or commenting on a coworkers statement, I analyze the body/facial expression of the other parties in the room. Most of the time my interpretation is a negative one. I am a first born child and am comfort able with my alone time and quite enjoy it but my ADHD makes me outgoing and talkative (though sometimes about obscure topics). I very much enjoy the connection from carrying on a conversation with someone and knowing that they understand and empathize with you. Throughout high-school I was the class clown. I always had some snide remark to make or an opinion to give on everything. I had my small group of friends but I felt that I annoyed even them. I graduated HS and decided enough was enough. I'm not gonna be that obnoxious guy anymore. I got back on my medicine and went off to college. Screwed up pretty bad my first semester and got kicked out of my housing (still enrolled ). I felt horrible about it because the offense that got me kicked out was something I told my parents I stopped doing a while back when they caught me. Anyway.. At this point I had just started to make friends outside of the people I knew from my hometown and I could see things about to turn around. But when I found out that I was being kicked out of my housing and wasting my parents 8k they had already spent on the following semester housing as well as the rent for the new place I fell into a really bad depression. I lost connection with all of my friends except one( who happened to be my previous roommate and got kicked out with me). We felt each other's pain and consoled one another with alcohol and Xbox one. I started drinking .. A lot. Like everyday. Ironically it didn't affect my grades though because we were still in freshman level courses and Calc always came easy to me. Fast forward 1 year. Me and roommate get a new place together and are doing great(or so it seems). We move into a little college apt complex where I already knew a ton of people. That first semester was great. We got along great daily and never fought. Shit we still have never fought. We hung out with the same group of friends and I was even more popular than him! I was having a great time and really loved my roommate/best friend like a brother. Then winter break came. All was going great. Still partying in my hometown and catching up with old friends and still hanging out with the ones that came home from school with me. Blah blah blah I ran into a girl from one of my classes downtown one night and we made plans to hangout. I brought a friend she brought a friend. The friend she brought ended up being my girlfriend and first love of 2 years. And my friend and the other girl hooked up a little but that's a different story.... Getting tired of typing on phone so I'm gonna wrap it up ... Roommate and Girl from downtown start talking. (Me and that girl always had some spark between us but never made a move on it again story for another time) girl talks shit about roommate behind his back to me (dumb) calls him gay and says she only hangs out with him for a gay cuddle buddy. I tell him he doesn't believe me. Asks her she denies it. She keeps talking shit. She starts getting really controlling and making him look like her puppy following her around and conforming to her every whim. It was nauseating. At this point there was a little tension between her and I as I was obviously not gonna take her side on things because she was manipulating my best friend and I was pretty blatant about that. But I decided to take the high road and still be her friend and what not. Things started to go south. She started to act weird and say passively rude things to me when she was drunk but never out right aggressive. She started to resent my other friend (the one that hooked up with her a while back ) and would be very aggressive with him at parties. To the point of getting him kicked out of a few. I didn't care, he was being an ass most of the time and deserved it. Then she started lumping me into her little outbursts. And one night she got particularly drunk and went off on him. Once he was kicked out she turned it on me. I didn't even listen to it though cause she was obviously obliterated so I just walked home. Next weekend there was a birthday party down the road from me and she was going as well as all my friends so I decided to go. Stayed for an hour or so but didn't know many people and was getting bored so I went to leave. Said my good byes to the people I knew there and went for the door. Saw roommate and girl sitting by the door. Said bye to roommate and went to say bye to her but she was obviously ignoring me so I patted her lightly on the head and kindly said ""bye 'girl'"" and opened the door. I hear ""did he just pat me on the head?? Is he calling me a dog or something ?!?"" I try to b line out of this drunken situation before it manifests into a full on shit show. But I was too late. She runs for the door and shoves me as much as she could and yells ""GET OUT!"" ( her signature drunken outburst at the time ) I turned around and calmly said ""'girl' I didn't mean to offend you, we're all friends here I'm sorry, you're just drunk"" or something along those lines. She stops her feet in place and yells for roommate at the top of her lungs. And like clock work he comes running out of no where and stands by her side. I had had enough so I just grabbed my girl by the arm and we walked home. Then things started to get weird. I talked to my roommate about it and asked him why she was mad at me. He said she wasn't. Okay cool. So i tried talking to her and she ignores me. Okay so I ask him again same response. Wtf roommate bros before hoes right? Apparently he had never heard the expression. Then a day would pass when I didn't see or hear from him. Which hadn't happened since the day I met him. Oh well I figured I'd let them work it out. Then weeks passed. Then we'd talk about bullshit. Then more weeks. Then a month. Then the semester was over and he left without saying a word. We had already signed a lease for the next semester and he told me a week before the next semester that he had backed out last minute and was living somewhere else. Great Well he moves in with some of my so called friends and then I lost contact with most of them as they were girls friends before mine. So I was slowly phased out of the group and then was all alone. And social anxiety has just snowballed. TL;DR : best friend didn't listen to bros b4 hoes and then took all my friends and left my by myself. Now I'm overly worried about being accepted",2
4ly0h4,outside," Contradicting feelings. Wanting both to be around people and to be alone.. I read a post on r/depression or here that the person felt.. isolated. I'd say that's accurate. In every situation where I'm in a group feel like I'm not part of the group. I'm just.. there... Sometimes I want to be all social and shit but at the same time there's a part of me that doesn't want the attention. I get very self conscious. They're looking at me now; am I sitting weirdly? Am I holding my arm in a weird way? They made a joke? I get out a short laugh. Now what. It feels awkward to just keep looking at them. It's also weird to just look away and basically ignore them. I'm so socially retarded. At work, at like a shitty call center or whatever, people are always talking to eachother. Sitting together, talking and laughing before work starts and during the break. I never say a word. I get there, I stand alone until work starts and during the break I just sit there or go outside for fresh air and do shit on my phone or something. Then back to work. Occasionally I'll exchange a word or two with someone sitting next to me. That's kinda nice. It's sorta like.. at moments I want to talk and be social and shit but part of me feels like that if it's successful and I'll be obligated to be social in the future and I just don't have the energy for that I want to be alone. But at the same time not. Sometimes someone on my left and someone and my right talk to eachother and I'm just there, on the phone, between them being slightly envious and annoyed at the same time. Sometimes I'll be like nope not gonna be affected by these dumb emotions ""just don't care"" ""just don't give a fuck anymore"" and then I'll actually see a person or be in a social situation and I'll feel all awkward and shit. Can't mind-over-matter it. ",2

4tztwl,"swimming, walk, biking","Managed to befriend someone(?) but when we hang out a part of me is just waiting until it's over / Friendship as a loner. So I go to this place(let's just say Place) once or twice a week and I see this guy there about once a week. I, a guy, had a little crush on him. It's good to note that I'm in my 20s, he's ~6 years older than me and I am in no way shape or form out, to anyone. When I found out he likes women my little crush subsided a bit. Not completely though. But a few stuff makes me pretty sure he's not bi either. Just wondering what his thoughts on gay people are. Recently found out he goes to church but unsure ""how religious"" he is. Could be partially to meet people and practice the language. I'm a loner. Introvert. What-have-you. * a person who is or prefers to be alone, especially one who avoids the company of others * The type of guy who dosen't have good social skills, No confidence and jealous traits. * Known as 'the boring guy', the 'friendless' guy, the invisible man After a few weeks of seeing him every now and then, he gave me his number and told me to call him if I wanted to do something. Like go swimming. I was anxious for days but ended up texting him. He had other plans. I was a bit proud of myself for actually texting and relieved I didn't ""have to"" hang out with someone. I'm the kind of person that just waits for things to happen to me. I follow the flow. Because I'm socially anxious and depressed I have no ambitions or future plans or aspirations or anything. I just wait for things to happen. I don't initiate. Note I don't really like this about myself but yah. Next time I met him we talked, he bought us both an icecream each, and suggested swimming again. When In the moment like that I feel like I should say yes, that it's probably ""good/better"" to actually socialise with someone. So I said yes. We've gone swimming two days in a row now. And afterwards we go pick some berries. It's been OK. I've felt dumb cus I didn't know the answer to some things. I felt boring and awkward because I didn't have a reply for most things. Like talk about cars and I'm like uh yeah. Mhm. I don't know how he's not bored of me. But he asked if I wanted to go swimming again. If he asks a question like A or B? I just don't know. You choose. ""You wanna keep swimming or should we get out?"" uh sure let's get out. : |. I'm just.. following along.. Even though it's been nice I guess, I kinda feel like.. I'm waiting for it to be over. Waiting for me to go home. At the same time I enjoy his company? It feels wrong.. to feel like this. Like.. this isn't how normal people are supposed to feel. Like I was slightly bored when we were picking berries. And it's like ahh I'm alone nice. That's kinda nice. But I'm bored a little. I'm a walking indecisive contradicting blob.

So I'm gonna be a senior this year and I've been doing cross country bc I knew I would regret it if I didn't do it at least one year. So I head to this camp, all is well until today when we had this trip to the dunes. Long story short I was at too fast a pace to want to stick with one group of girls and too slow to catch up with another group that was headed much farther out. I ended up running on my own for over an hour and a half until the assistant coach found me. She went to tell some park ranger that she'd found me, and then ran with me to the rest of the group. She explained how they were looking for me and all that, which was when the anxiety started kicking in. When we joined the rest of the group it was super awkward.. the other girls kinda looked at me and this nagging thought/feeling kept telling me I was a major inconvenience to them and that I had ruined what could have been a perfectly nice outing. I felt/feel that no one really wanted me there. I'm worried that it seems as if I was slacking off or something to them when in reality I was running the whole time, worried and anxious, swatting away at/plucking off ticks that landed on my head (I was running through a wooded area that was kind of swampy in some parts).

4x77zj,outside,"Memories of the past are tormenting me.. I know I have whined about this in the past at some point here or another site maybe. But when I return to my parents house, it all slaps me back and I feel depressed again. I'm a 23 year old female, have been struggling with SA in middle school ( at that point i had no idea what i had) which got significantly better at highschool and deteriorated after going away for college. Most people become more outgoing in college since parents arent there to hold you back, but not for me. I got closed up in my shell even more and managed to even lose my old friends, one of which had been my friend since kindergarten. Everyone moved out for college, and after i tried many times to keep in touch and hang out, they always cancelled and never initiated anything. It pains me so much to think about how adulthood changed us to the point of having completely opposite interests. The few times we met during college, I felt like they were different people. It's been years since i cut off all ties and i have no friends at all. I sit outside at night and remember our mischiefs and sleepovers and i want to cry. I feel that even in my teens i had this spark of adventure, you know? I was terrified of social situations but i won over it because I thought of everything as an adventure. Now as an adult, i have no interest in anything. Every person i meet is just another "" normie"" i have to deal with. Every social situation is something i have to avoid at all costs, or endure until it is over and i can go home. When I was a teen, I had a different image of my future self. Strong, confident, a smart computer engineer with a job and degree. I am none of these, i haven't even finished college. I feel i am a disappointment to my old self. To my young self who desperately wanted a change. It feels like i am growing inside a box, only the box size stays the same and it's more and more suffocating.

4xv61w,"walk, outside","Friendless people, the key to not feeling like the worst person in the world is to stop caring (to state the obvious). For a while I never understood people who posted on here and on other subs saying they have no friends but they're okay with that. If they're okay with it it won't change! But I was wrong. 90% of people are going to think you're a weirdo for not having friends, but they don't know you, and they're shallow. No one is going to support your loneliness so you might as well accept that sometimes shit happens in life and you end up alone for a while but that's okay and natural. I think the guilt of loneliness affects your mental health before the actual loneliness does. Growing up I became more and more aware of my lack of friends. I had more friends then than I have now, but less than most people I knew. For a long time I didn't see the problem. When I didn't see my lack of friends as a problem, this meant that when I was having a social interaction I wasn't self conscious. I didn't have my mothers voice in the back of my head telling me I should have more friends. I remember in school, between the ages of 12-16, I would yap and yap to anyone, and no, I didn't make friends with everyone I talked to, but I made some, and was generally liked. As I got older, I cut off a group of friends from my home town because I had nothing in common with them and they were preoccupied with being popular and I wasn't. My mam would always say that I needed more friends when she noticed I stopped hanging around them. I remember I brought 2 friends home for dinner and my sister said ""oh look, her friends. All 2 of them"". I became more aware of my loneliness. As my awareness increased, I got more withdrawn, basically a hermit, was overly critical of myself and overly self conscious. Because everyone around me was telling me it wasn't okay to have few friends, even though I had been happy. Something that struck me in college was how everyone sort of acted as if they wanted to be perceived as popular. This was probably my warped SA perception, and this stopped me from talking to people. Sometimes I read threads here, particularly /r/relationships (my favourite sub) and see people talking about how having no friends is a ""red flag"" and that ""boring people finish last"" and that when you have no friends ""you're the common denominator"" and there's something wrong with you. I see where they're coming from, and while reading things like this serves to make us all more self aware, it doesn't make it easier, and it's not healthy to blame yourself. I had an epiphany recently and I realized that... people in my hometown probably don't talk about me negatively, if I talked to them they'd probably be open to me. People I meet daily that I think hate me, don't hate me, if they do they're basing it off one encounter, they don't know me and I shouldn't care. When I walk my dog, people who see me out in public don't know I'm unemployed and friendless, or that my hair is really greasy. No one but me has felt my pain or understands, so screw it. Even if I have screwed up my reputation by being a recluse, it's so easy to change how people see you, if you only have the courage to try. There's no point in feeling guilt about SA. We are going to find friends at some point or another, our SA will die down eventually with personal growth or outside help. We might as well be okay with our circumstances in the meantime. I used to spend all my alone time (so, all the time) feeling bad about it, but what's the point? That will only make me more bitter. Let's stop acting like having no friends is the worst thing in the world. We're not actually missing out on much, maybe this realization will help us to stop trying too hard in social situations and messing up. Loneliness is painful but only because other people make it painful by reminding us how flawed we are. I know it's impossible to implement ""stop caring"" overnight, but please try. I hope other friendless people out there can get to the point in life where they don't care what others think, because after 22 years it has finally freed me. *Tl;dr: People make us feel shit for not having friends. But realize if people didn't make us feel shit about ourselves, we'd probably be okay. Try and get to the point where you realize that it's okay to be who you are and be happy alone. Stop comparing yourself to others and just stop caring what people think. Don't let people's opinions of you drive your self esteem into the ground*",2

I was dressed casually but not scruffy and fitting for a hot sunny day. After taking my earplugs out I approached the counter and a waitress was there and we made eye contact. It took her a small fraction of a second to shout 'creeper' rather indiscreetly to one of her colleagues somewhere else. Suffice to say, it was rather awkward after that and though I ordered my latte and put my music back in my afternoon was ruined. It was horrible. I might have done something wrong to offend her sensibilities but I assure you it was nothing 'creepy'. I thought I was playing by the rules, walking the tightrope, but it seems I upset her. And I feel bad about it, I hate feeling awkward, irritating, creepy or scary. I keep making an effort to pass off normally (nice clothes, exercise etc.) but why should it be so hard?

Nobody talks to me, im too shy and don't know how, and i usually don't have much in common with people. I hope my classmates don't fucking hate me or something but in class im always telling jokes and stuff keeping class fun. People have said that they hate me, at least 1 was serious i dont know if the other is joking. But otherwise like, I dont think ive done anything wrong? I dont know why I cant make any friends. Literally all i care about is making friends im so depressed that the only thing i want literally everything i do is cause i want to get friends.

It's fucking confusing. I honestly don't feel like overanalyzing it anymore. I want to just talk to her she sits behind me in class. But I can't. Lately I've even convinced myself she likes me but i still cant do it. I don't know how. I'm not even really scared. I just don't know how. Oh yeah and even when i do make friends they don't give a fuck about me. From my old school people I knew for my whole life haven't talked to me once. I went to a camp and I fucking cried cause it was the only time i felt i had friends (everyone there was close though almost everyone was crying it was alot of the kids my age last year).

5460t9,outside,"Social anxiety/depression returns after Mom passes away...Looking for someone to talk to. I am 24/F. I am not sure how to message ppl on here but feel I'll just vent anyhow... I have basically had depression since the age of 12. I have spent my entire teenage life caring for my Mother who worked construction her entire life which was detrimental to her health. I remember as a child an incident where she went into the hospital because she mentally checked out because of the pain and when she woke up she lost her memory for two weeks. As a child I was confused as to why she couldn't remember me. So much has happened that I started blaming myself for the way she was and hated myself for living because she wouldnt be working so hard if she had me. I also have a special needs brother who she and I cared for also when his attendants working. I was home schooled so I missed out on my education because of caring for her full time. I did however get my GED in the year of 2014..this gave me confidence that I wasn't completely worthless and that I was capable of doing something other than playing video games and loathing in self-hate. I was sheltered and remember it being so bad I would only go outside once a month for a year. I wanted no parts of living but my Mom was my everything to keep going. I got to the point that I had to have a break, so I made plans for my Aunt to care for her just for me to leave to get myself together. This time I was gone, I found fitness, nutrition, yoga, meditation which made me feel happy and in control of something in my life for the first time. 7 months of this and I get a call that My Mom has passed away....I dont want to go too much further into it but ever since then I have lost that motivation and passion of waking up and feel myself sinking back into that sad girl who locked herself away from the world......I know it's something I have to do for myself and that I have to want it bad enough to break out of it but it's so hard and I never ask anyone for help...ever.

57por7,walk,"Thanks, social anxiety, you make me panic and then I fuck things up back to back to back. I'm sick of it. I'll just get right into the story of what just took place. Incoming wall of text, bear with me. So I'm good friends with my neighbors and I was at their place hanging out when they decided they want to go bar hopping. They asked me if I wanted to go and I decided what the hell, why not? I've never been bar hopping, not even a bar since I turned 21 (in April. Normally I just go to the liquor store down the street and drink with my roommate or by myself). I told them I've never done it before so if they could guide me through it that'd be great, and they said sure. So it comes time to start walking. One of the guys is already drunk, the other is super experienced with this stuff. I felt so out of place. Not to mention they were wearing shirts that supported the home team (football game AND homecoming tonight, that alone should have told me it'd be way too busy for me to handle, especially for my first time at a bar). I was wearing what I normally wear, some jeans and a black sweater and nasty grey vans that I wore to work today and forgot to change out of. Not to mention these guys are way taller than me. I'm not even short, I'm 5""11 but they were a few inches taller than me so all of this combined made me feel so out of place. So basically I was going into a social anxiety nightmare already anxious a fuck for other reasons than I was going out. Fuck. The walk took about 15 minutes, felt like forever, but when I got to the bar, I felt like it didn't take long enough. This bar was packed beyond reason. Inside it didn't look like there was anywhere to even move. And the line was massive. Halfway up, my friend decided now was the best time to mention there's a $5 front. I didn't know what that meant (in case someone doesn't either, it means a $5 fee to get in). I had already told him I didn't have any cash on me but he said don't worry, they take debit cards. Here's where I really start to panic. I ask if he can spot me and he said no, I should have brought cash with me. Fucking hell. Second panic: the people behind me are so close, like they kept brushing up against me and bumping into me. I can't stand people touching me unexpectedly. But I'm at a bar, obviously that happens. But I start to freak out thinking the people around me can hear me say I don't have the money, asking me friend, not knowing what to do, thinking they think I'm a loser for not knowing how to do this. I'm just about to leave because I'm about to have a break down. I tell my ""friend"" I think I'm just going to bail. He's like yea okay whatever. I then start thinking the people behind me are thinking I'm even more of a loser for bailing and not doing what everyone else is doing. I end up saying fuck it and I start walking away. I walked towards the Taco Bell across the street and call my roommate and ask him to pick me up there. He said he was actually on his way to his girlfriend's. I said oh never mind then, I don't want you to drive all that way. He said it's not a big deal and he comes to pick me up. Now I feel bad about inconveniencing him. So now I'm home by myself and alone with my thoughts and self loathing. I already told my boss I'm not coming in tomorrow because I'm going out, further inconveniencing someone else. Thinking about getting drunk as hell just to say tonight wasn't a complete waste. I don't know what I was thinking, going out for my first time to a bar on one of the busiest nights. I just felt like a turd the whole time and felt like I fucked things up over and over again. Sorry for the huge rant. Anyone else have similar experiences they want to share because of their SA? Update: it's 2:39 am now and I'm alone and drunk. Friend told me the night ended being shit anyway, they didn't get into the really busy bar. They went to one crappy bar and I turned out to be a really shitty night all around for them.

5i2iu6,grass,"As a homeschooler, I feel like something was stolen from me.. Hello everyone. This is my first time posting here, I'll try to keep it simple and organized. I have been homeschooled from Pre-K to senior year, and I am 18 now. For the most part I have been oblivious to the public perception of this method of teaching. I see everywhere online that it's kind of frowned upon. People say that homeschoolers are anti-social white-trash potential school shooters. Everytime I see these comments I feel a strong pang in my chest. I actually don't consider myself to be very weird, I am kind of average to be honest. I am obsessed with music, love my netflix, and enjoy travelling. Not very weird I wouldn't think. I try very hard to hide the fact that I was homeschooled, simply because I immediately get lumped into these stereotypes. As a homeschooler, I feel like something was stolen from me. I never asked to be different. It doesn't feel fair to me that I have this burden of an alternate lifestyle. I think it kind of stems from my personality. I hate conflict and hostile opinions. Which might be caused by my homeschooling. Such a mess right? My mother has a strong passion for homeschooling, and I remember her telling me that she would cry if I decided (or got forced by CPS) to go to public school. This created a sort of ""guilty conscious, or feeling that I have to stick with the program to keep her happy. She would actually threaten to ""put me in public school"" if I tried to talk to her about my doubts. Don't get the wrong idea about her though, I love her and can kind of see where she's coming from. She may have had a bad time in high school, so it's like a terror to her. But, I don't feel like I would have had the same experience. Sometimes I daydream about what I could have been like if I went to public school. Maybe I would some kind of sauve marauder! Or at least I would be assertive enough, self-relient, and have a good group of friends. Instead, I am just an awkward burden for most people my age. I feel like I was cheated a better life almost. I also have extreme insecurities when it comes to intelligence. Actually, anytime I think I see proof of my being stupid, I respond emotionally. Again, the pang in my chest feeling. I feel like my education could have been better, for the past few years I have mainly been teaching myself because my mom is hella busy. I am working on my ACT and I'll hopefully get into college, which I am not sure I can do since I am a homeschooler. I don't even know if I have a GPA, because there hasn't been any kind of grading going on, not that I know of anyway. I am really good at math, but not so good at factoid/common-sense stuff. Right now I am in a jiu-jitsu class (free at my gym) and my instructor will constantly ask for a factoid, like ""How much blood is in the body?"" or ""What's the fastest animal on Earth"". I couldn't answer either of these, and it really bothers me. I feel like I should know this stuff, and I might have known it if I was in public school. Sometimes I will know one, but can't think of it fast enough. Somehow, I always end up looking like an idiot in front of my class. Whether it be not answering questions, or having an insanely hard time with directions and spatial awareness. Yes, the homeschooling was for religious reasons. My mom says it's because she met a homeschooler and was impressed, but I kind of doubt that. She's an extreme Christian of sorts. She taught me creation science for a while, but I learned how it's fraudulent. I have a basic understanding of evolution now, but I probably don't know as much as other people my age. She's also a big conspirator. Alex Jones, 9/11 Truth, FEMA, etc. I believed these too, but have since shaken them off. I am actually still in the closet about a lot of this stuff because I don't want to have a heated discussion with her. I am still a Christian, but I have a lot of problems with religion. I guess it's more of a personal thing that I don't feel the need to express or go to church for. I have never had a girlfriend. I have never even had a kiss before. I have held hands with a girl and I took one on a date. But, the date was a disaster (she was kind of a bitch, and she didn't consider it to be a date) and the ""holding hands"" part grossed me out. It's starting to drive me crazy in a way, I really want to experience love, romance, and sex are like. But I feel like I have been permanently cockblocked by my upbringing. I'll probably die a virgin. Anytime I have been close to starting something up with a girl, my mom wasn't too far behind me. I feel like once they see my mom and the interactions we have, they write me off as a ""momma's boy"" and immediately lose any attraction they once had. I am actually a pretty attractive looking guy, but the way I am drives them away. I have never had a job (unless you could call mowing your grandmother's grass a real job). I have a supreme fear of the unknown here. Like I feel like they won't hire me because I am not the best at social skills. Or, I feel like I am going to fuck up really bad with whatever they assign for me. Or, I feel like I will get bullied by coworkers and have a horrible time there. The real world is a scary concept to me, I have seen how horrible people can be on the internet (especially with the 'kys' and red hot angry comments). I feel like I am too soft for the world, too sheltered. I feel like I will get eaten alive almost. So, it creates a vicious cycle, I don't know when I'll get a job, or what job I will get. But I know I need to get one because I'll need a source of income soon (I rarely spend my money, so I have a lot of it). Because I don't have a job and don't exactly have a ""rich family"". I don't have a phone, or a car. I have to use my parents phone and car anywhere I go, and I hate it. It severely stifles my freedom. I couldn't go do anything without them knowing, I know this for a fact. My dream is to shed the stereotypical image I have and live a meaningful life. I want to have good friends, a wife, a good job, a house, etc. I don't want to be seen as that weird guy, or that loner, I want to be somebody. I don't know where to start, even though I was brought up in a good household (no domestic violence or anything), I carry a lot of baggage.

My hope is that I can inspire people to see that it is truly is possible for anyone to massively and significantly improve themselves and fight through their own social anxiety. Warning, this post is quite long, but if you enjoy reading about a person’s journey’s to self-improvement, then this post is for you. A bit of backstory on me. I’m 22 right now, but I’ve been fighting social anxiety ever since I was in fifth grade (that’s rounds out to about half of my life). For as long as I remember, I hated myself, and there was a multitude of reasons for this such as growing up poor in a rich area, being different from all my peers (mixed race, foreign sounding name, etc.), and not seeing a healthy relationship between my mother and father. The way I coped with my insecurities was through video games. Lots and lots of video games. It was so easy to escape the reality I hated by living in another one that made me feel alive. I did this for years and years, throughout middle school and especially through high school and into college. With all the time I invested into video games, I was severely underdeveloped in my social skills, and I’d even pit myself in the bottom 10% next to anti-social deaf people. Everywhere I go, I would avoid eye contact with people. I hated even going outside and seeing other people, because I just knew how awkward and weird they would think I am for the way I looked and the way I walked. Class was a nightmare. I’d try to sit in the back, and every time the teacher would call on me, my heart would race to the speed of light, and my voice would quiver as I attempted to formulate a semi-coherent sentence. By now you might be wondering how the hell did I transform from this video game addicted, socially awkward boy with low self-esteem into a person that could stand up for himself? Answer: I got tired. Tired of living life feeling like a piece of shit. Tired of not even being able to look into the mirror without cringing. Tired of thinking I wasn’t worth anyone’s time, and that I’ll die alone. And that’s when I discovered /r/socialanxiety. For the first time I saw that I wasn’t the only one in the world dealing with what I thought was my own unique personal hell. I heard stories, stories of peoples’ struggles, and even some of their success. But to be honest, I never found enough actionable advice here to steer my life in the right direction, so I started looking elsewhere. I started looking at other subreddits, and I even started reading self-improvement books and listening to podcasts. Somewhere around this point, something finally clicked in my head that me realize that change is possible, “even for me.” Here are three steps I followed to transform my life after believing that I could transform my life: Step 1) I started an exercise regimen and eating healthier. Even though my routine sucked and I made every mistake in the book, the small progress I made further made me see that I could improve my own physique through grit and not shoving junk food down my throat. Let’s not kid ourselves, appearances do matter, not so much that they should dominate every ounce of your thought and life focus, but I’ve come to learn that neglecting it and pretending like it doesn’t matter only perpetuated a cycle of negative thoughts about myself such as “I’ll never look good, I’m not like that, I’m ugly, etc.” If you feel ugly now, working out and dressing decently can unsurprisingly improve the way you feel about yourself. Try it. If you’re fighting social anxiety like I was, you’re going to need every bit of improvement you can get and this one can even be done without any social interaction (though that is against the road of improvement). Step 2) I started paying attention to my body language. I think this may be one of the hardest points to tackle as a person with SA, and I can’t even say that my own personal body language is in tip top shape as of yet, but I can say that even by being aware that body language exists puts you miles ahead of the average person with SA. So much communication is portrayed through the body, such as standing up straight, not looking down at the ground, and even just how you deal with silence. If you’re a guy and you’re into girls, this a quality that is heavily observed, much more so than the verbal communication. If you’re a girl, you probably know this and have more of knack for this than the average guy does. However complicated this may seem, simple things that I mentioned such as standing up straight and keeping your head-up can psychologically boost your mood. Step 3) I did things I was uncomfortable with, step by step. I think this is the hardest and most crucial step of my process, and it could be divided into countless sub-steps and stories, but I want to hit the main point that the only way to become comfortable is to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. Here’s an example. I’m at grocery store, I really don’t want to ask the worker for help finding an item. But I do it, just to see what will happen. I’m nervous. I approach her and ask where the broccoli is. She tells me it’s on aisle seven. “Shit I don’t where aisle seven is, should I ask her, no she’ll think I’m weird.” I nod okay and walk away quickly. “Shit, why didn’t I ask her to point me to where aisle seven is .“ I find another worker, then ask if he can show me to aisle seven, and sure enough he happily tells me where to go. I realize this isn’t so bad and am now not afraid to ask for directions. The point of this example is take small steps and experiment for yourself. The more you do, the more you will learn. And I hate to say it, but most of what we learn isn’t through others, but by our own doing, and especially doing things that we think will suck. Now I could tell my own personal stories on this topic for pages and pages, but I want to highlight that I’ve done things as uncomfortable as confronting someone about their shitty behavior, asking girls to dates (*gasp*, no way, how is that possible, as my old self would say), actually being on the date and making mistakes (learning mistakes I’ll have you know), and even performing on a stage in front of a live audience. But the most recent highlight is negotiating my salary at my current job. I did my research about my current job that I’m getting hired for, and I noticed that I was being heavily underpaid for the position. I knew that being underpaid would make me feel resentment as an employee and not allow me to do my best work, so I decided “fuck it, rather than have a terrible time at this position feeling passive-aggressive about my situation and being weird in the office, I’m going to tackle this right now.” I looked up as many negotiation tactics as possible, spent time in the shower for a week debating with my manager in my imagination, and finally reassured myself that I know my worth. I approached my manager 2 days ago. Long story short, I nailed the negotiation and got a 10k salary raise. All the uncomfortable things I ever dealt with leading up to this made me the person I was going into that negotiation. All the hard work, mistakes, pain, and learning that I did made me become someone who was worthy of that 10k raise. If you threw 16 year old, or even 20 year old socially awkward me into the same position, I would not have not have raised a single word. I probably would not have even passed the interview for this job. As long as this post has been, there’s so many details that I left out, but I really hope that I’ve demonstrated that it is truly is possible to fight your own social anxiety, and even use it as fuel to better yourself. I still have lots of room to grow, and I’m not the most socially savvy or charming person you’ll ever meet, but I can say with confidence and pride that I’m 100 times better than the person I used to be.",2
5k1s0m,"outside, walk"," Will soon be having a conversation with my manager about my SA... Hey guys. So I'm a lower level supervisor where I work and today I had to get together with a group of my co-workers and my manager to go over some things that they (co-workers) haven't been completing on a consistent basis. Performance stuff basically. My manager and I had talked the night before about how we were going to approach the meeting and we agreed I would try and take the lead on most of the conversation and he would chime in when necessary. He, as well as a majority of management (big company, lots of higher-ups) know that I have some anxiety issues, but don't really know the extent of it for the most part. So the meeting didn't go all that great. Not terrible, but not very good. I started things off and kind of just nose dived into what the group of co-workers had done wrong the day before. No intro, no nice lead in or explanation as to why we were there. Just ""ok so this wasn't done, that was dirty, this wasn't taken care of.."" etc, etc. My manager ended up back-packing the meeting per usual and the day continued on as it normally would. Well towards the end of the day he wanted to get together again (just him and I) so that we could talk about how it went. We go into the same room where we held the meeting that morning which is this bright ass (like apple store bright) conference room and we start to chat. We go over some normal day to day stuff and then we get on the subject of how we think the meeting went. I told him I think it could have gone better and he agrees which is why he wanted to talk with me to begin with. I told him I'm particularly aware of my public speaking difficulties and that I know I could have directed the meeting in a more constructive way. I told him I struggle with certain things and that I've been devoting a lot of time outside of work to try and help with that stuff. Then he stopped me and asked me what type of struggles.. I paused for a second and said ""oh, well I have anxiety and uh.."" pause, not looking at him.. ""it's just been really hard and, uh.."" At this moment I started to well up with tears. He could tell I was on the verge of crying and I knew I would if I said anything else so I told him I needed to step away for a second. So I stepped into an empty office and just tried to wait out the emotion. I was completely, utterly overwhelmed. After a couple minutes he came over and asked me if I'd Iike to walk outside with him for a bit. We took a walk around the neighboring businesses while I, thoroughly embarrassed, stammered out the few sentences of explanation that I could (I should say that my manager is a really good dude, fairly close to my age and also super understanding). He let me know that he's all ears if I'd like to try and talk about everything at a later time as I was just about finished with my shift for the day. I told him that I've actually been wanting to do that for a while so we agreed that he'd give me a call within the next couple of days to discuss things.. I know I need to talk about a lot with him, I just don't know *how* much. Do I tell him the full truth? That I'm severely depressed because of my SA and that if affects me every day of my life? That it drastically inhibits my ability to perform as a supervisor? I was on the verge of breaking down at work which is something I've never done, ever. Let alone in front of my boss. I've spent my whole life trying to hide my SA and have developed an ultra thick, guarded wall as a result. I've avoided these types of conversations with people (other than my family) because of how overwhelming the emotions become. I'm scared that if I completely open up to him I'll raise serious questions about my ability to perform my job requirements. Either way, the dynamic between him and I will absolutely not be the same after this convo. This post became way, waay longer than I meant it to be. Cheers if you made it all the way to the end. Thank you..sincerely, for any responses. TL;DR I ended up nearly crying in front of my manager after being overwhelmed with emotions when asked to elaborate on my struggles with SA. We planned a follow up conversation at a later time so that I can gather myself and allow for a proper explanation. Now I'm just not sure how much I want to share with him as I'm scared it might jeopardize my job, or at least my standings within my department. ",2
5mkbsk,outside,"18  and useless. My story of Social Anxiety. I used to be that funny guy in class. In Elementary  and Middle School I was always the guy that tried to make everyone laugh but made a fool of myself. Looking back now I realized at a young age I was scared to talk to girls. In the 3rd grade I had a PSP that I would go on Facebook with  and just try to socialize on there. Every year I spent locked up in my room just watching videos on YouTube, playing Xbox  and barely socializing. I never had a girlfriend but always talked to girls over twitter  and instagram. I graduated high school with a 2.30 gpa  and didn't learn a damn thing. I'm going to be starting my 2nd semester at a Community College but have no desire to go. I have no passion or goals for my future. I'm not working because I am literally not good at anything  and am terrified to socialize with people. Don't get my wrong I have two great loving parents  and two younger sisters. I feel horrible because my younger sisters look up to me and I'm a horrible role model. I hate school so much but what else am I going to do with my life then? I'm starting to lose my two closest friends because I never want to leave my house. My mom practically does everything for me. Whenever I do go outside I have the ugliest look on my face because I just hate my life. I was prescribed an antidepressant but didn't take it because I'm afraid of the side effects. I often think about suicide by overdosing on the pills but that would just crush my family  and put them in serious debt with the cost of my funeral. I just wish there was just a reset button so I could live a completely different life. I feel so alone  and see nothing for my future.",2
5s1m14,soccer,"I think I had a little breakthrough on why I have SA. so this might be a bit of a read and I'll try to keep it short. So ever since I was born till about 5th or 6th grade I was always a outgoing kid just the polar opposit of how I am today. I wasn't shy I could male new friends and talk to other kids with no worries at all. I went to a school that was k-8 I stayed there all the way till 8th grade and so did pretty much everyone from my starting kindergarten class did the same so we were real close shared birthday parties , had sleepovers all of us were on a soccer team for a good while. But at around 5th grade i started to get a bit chubby i dont know if it was pubery or my aunt always giving me treats. And the same friends who i had known since kindergarten started teasing me not all but most also we were kinda finding who we were and making our groups of friends. So this put me down to where i didnt wanna go to birthday parties anymore or do things with them because i knew I would be made fun of or called fat or asked why my face was red all the time so i started staying home alot. My dad didn't like this so he would make me go to these events where i would be teased. I never told him and I would have to make a scene to not go. So he gave up on me going and i kinda just stayed at home all the way till we graduated till 8th grade I wasn't the weird kid everyone made fun of i had friends i guess I just got used to being teased brushed it off and all that bit it bothered me i would have breakdowns cry askingy parents if I was fat. I went to a different high school then everyone else didn't grt teased and felt a bit better i geaduated got in shape and all but all of that just kinda left a mark. I feel i dont have social anxiety because while i do get nervous going to a interview or meeting someone or starting a new job. I more freaking out oit about what the person thinks about how i look how i talk what I say how I performy duties. Pretty much the teasing i endured and kinda sucked up and bottled up left me with a inferiority complex, slight case of body dismorhia, and extremely low self esteem that all form this trifecta of shit that causes me to think I have social anxiety when really its just all those other things Tl;DR my social anxiety stems from being teased and mocked for being a chubby kid in elementary causinge me to have low self esteem, inferority complex and slight body dismorhia. Sorry I know the punctiation is shit on here im writing this on the bus ride home",2
5tsyy7,"coast, camp, outside","Should I talk to her?. This is going to be a long story as there is a lot of backstory/context needed to understand. Those who are ‘meant’ to read this  and offer guidance, will. I hope :) No idea how to cut it down into a TLDR as it is far too lengthy. I'll try to keep this first backstory as short  and to the point as possible. I'm 21, live in Australia on the east coast, grew up in Sydney and lived there until I was 18. I have a sister who is 7 years older who still lives in our hometown. Lost my father at a young age at 13. I've been battling depression for over 5 years since I was 15. I moved 2 hours away from my hometown at 18  and my depression got much worse. I stopped seeing friends, stopped going out, stopped talking to my friends/family which led to dealing with anxiety issues which led to social anxiety due to isolating myself. (Among other symptoms) I've recently started seeing a psychologist, getting out of the house more, I'm finally starting to feel like going out  and doing things. I want to meet people. I've been out more/done more in January of this year than I have the past 2 years. Finally starting to feel 'normal'. I still haven't reconnected with any of my old friends. I haven't posted anything on my personal social media accounts (Facebook/Instagram/Snapchat) since I first moved in late 2014. Haven't spoken to any friends since then  and haven't seen them either. Some have reached out to me but I never replied. Haven’t had a job since I moved up here either. For some reason I'm still afraid to reach out to them because I know that will lead to eventually meeting up with them in person. I'm even afraid to post anything on social media from fear of them reaching out to me. Because I know this will lead down the same route. I haven't made any new friends since moving from my hometown, haven't worked or studied  and basically feel like a complete failure. Afraid of what they will say, think or feel about me cos I have no life per say. I have already made a post looking for advice/guidance regarding the issue related to my old friends, however the above context was necessary to lead onto my next story which I am solely looking for advice/guidance for. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ New years eve I went to a house party with my older Sister cos I had nothing else to do, literally, and met all her friends etc. People were drinking, majority of people were on drugs, MDMA, LSD  and Ketamine was available. I hadn’t had drugs for 3 years since Australia day in 2014 when I was 18. I didn’t plan on taking anything. I met a girl who lived there, friend of my sisters who’s my age - lets call her Mary. I was told by a few people she thought I was attractive  and wanted to hookup. I haven’t hooked up with anyone for over 2 years and I actually was thinking that about her anyway so I was keen. I was drinking a lot when I first got there because of my anxiety, meeting new people etc. and ended up having to stop drinking because I was getting sick mixing it with weed. (Only drank 4 times last year so I had a very low tolerance). A few hours later I was in Marys room with her, my sister  and another girl who lived there just talking; lets call her Barbara. Barbara asked if we all wanted to get any more MDMA caps (her bf had stuff people could buy during the night). All of them had already taken an MDMA cap each earlier on in the night  and they all said yeah to having another one, which left me to decide; I ended up asking for one since I felt comfortable, didn’t feel pressured by them and the moment felt right to do it (granted my judgement was way off cause I was drinking/smoking; not the best idea to jump on drugs with people you barely know, but I felt safe being with my sister). So I took mine with them  and they left me and Mary in the room not long after. Started talking to Mary, getting to know her and all that. Basically having a d andm. She was telling me that she is going overseas this year to a US summer camp for 6 weeks. I felt so unaccomplished  and like a loser basically because there’s no way I could do that. I told her she’s really ambitious  and we started talking about other things while smoking weed together. We ended up hooking up for awhile, kissed at midnight  and started talking more after that. At one point while we were outside having a cigarette, she asked me to tell her ‘my life story’, it caught me off guard cos if I’m honest I don’t even know what it is. I got about halfway through  and somehow we got interrupted and I never got to hear hers or finish mine. I realised I was saying a lot of bad things that had happened in my life, rather than who I am and what I do? Anyway, Mary  and Barbara decided to come back with me, my sister  and her partner back to their place about an hour or two after Midnight to spend the rest of the night together. They were all going to take a tab of LSD each when we got back, I didn’t want to have psychedelics so I had a second MDMA cap. When we got back to my sisters place , Mary  and Barbara lost an acid tab when we got there. Eventually we all gave up looking for it  and they all took a tab each. Not long after taking the tab it got kinda weird with her, her vibe changed  and she wasn’t talking much, we weren’t as ‘close’ physically as earlier (not cuddling n stuff) but we were holding hands? They were all waiting for the LSD to kick in  and everyone wasn’t really talking much, and cos I hadn’t taken a tab I wasn’t on the same ‘level’. I think that’s where things changed cos my 2nd MDMA cap was coming on while her tab was coming on so we were on different wavelengths. We were all chilling in the lounge room laying down for about an hour and it was pretty obvious Barbara was the 5th wheel. Mary, her friend  and my sister went into her room and were talking for awhile. Eventually they came out and we all went for a cigarette on the balcony and they basically came and said they were leaving. They were going to stay the night then an hour or two later after we got back they said they were leaving cos her friend wanted to be with her boyfriend. I was too out of it to leave the unit  and when I said ‘I’m too f*cked to leave when Mary asked me if I was coming she said 'well your ambitious’. Never has my gut dropped so much. Instant regret. Such a horrible feeling, intensified by the drugs. I’m sure they left cos they started feeling uncomfortable being there, particularly Marys friend being the 5th wheel without her BF on new years eve. My sister, her partner  and I all planned on coming back to their placed to end the night there regardless, a safe place to come back to. So we kind of all had it in our head that we weren’t leaving after we got back. Looking back I wish I went back with Mary  and her friend but it probably wasn’t the best idea because they ended up taking another tab and ‘day-tripped’. Which could have ended up quite messy since it was pretty messy after they left anyway just being with my sister n her partner. Who knows what would happened - I never will know cos I chose not to go. I told my sister n her partner the next morning what Mary said when she left  and I asked them if I screwed up by not going back with her - my sisters husband said yeah i thought I heard her say something like that but my sister sort of dismissed it. They were both pretty adamant that I hadn’t ‘fucked up’ though - the next day my sister said she spoke to Mary on FB and asked her about what she said before she left that night  and she said that she didn't say that at all, something like 'oh alright then' was what she apparently said but I didn't really believe it. Mary sent me a message first on snapchat a couple days after new years basically saying ‘hey was nice to meet you had a nice time  and we said we should chill n have a sesh sometime’ etc. So we started talking a little bit, went to buy weed from their place a day later  and added her on FB but didn’t ask for her number. Such an idiot. Anyway, It was my sisters birthday the first week of 2017  and she had a party the first weekend (7th Jan - Saturday), Mary  and I were both going so we were going to catch up there. I was talking to her leading up to my sisters bday party after i came home on the Thursday and then the next night I had a panic attack after smoking some weed (happened cos of repressed emotions from traumatic domestic event in late 2016)  and went to the doctor the next morning for a referral to a psychologist along with some sort of temporary medication to help me sleep  and I haven't spoken to her since. And with all my anxiety i'm afraid to even talk to her because its been over a month and she probably thinks I’m a rude douchebag but then again she may not even think twice about it. My sister said she knows I have a lot going on in my life at the moment so she probably doesn’t mind. I felt like I got attached to her way too quickly after that night, or perhaps attached to the idea of potentially being with someone? Since it had been so long since I’ve actually had that physical connection with someone it was quite difficult to just ‘let go’ and forget about it. I became afraid of this attachment and decided to stop talking to her to detach myself, I didn’t want to come across as needy or obsessive. Couldn’t stop thinking about her for 2 weeks afterwards. Avoiding talking to her ended up making me think of her more. She hasn’t messaged me since I didn’t reply to her last message so as far as she’s concerned she may not even think about me at all? When I was younger I used to talk to girls day  and night (not exactly proud of it) but my point is I had confidence, I wasn't anxious or insecure - like I’m too afraid to even message Mary? I just feel awkward after hooking up with her, when I went to her place  and added her on FB I was so awkward around her, didn’t know how to act around her after hooking up  and being so f*cked from the drugs lol - I just want to be able to talk to her and get to know her,  and i don’t really feel like getting to know her through text is how I want to do it either, I’d rather do it in person. But then I’m awkward in person after hooking up lol, don’t how to be. Don’t know what to do, she keeps popping in my head. Feel like I’m not worthy enough, not enough self worth  and confidence. No job, no car, no license, no friends, what do I have to offer? I lift weights, I’m fit, I’m healthy, I’m intelligent, I’m educated, own my own business, I feel like I’m attractive - definitely not ugly, but can barely bring myself to message her on Facebook. Am I just mentally stuck on this whole thing? Do I need to let it go  and move on? I know the next move would be to reach out to her again  and eventually ask to meet up in person  and go from there. But my social anxiety is stopping me. I feel like there is a lot that has gone unsaid between us that should be spoken about  and idk if thats me overthinking it but I don’t even know how to bring that up to her either. I feel so weird thinking all of this when I barely know her. I just don’t know what to do, or how to ask her how she feels about the whole thing cos apparently she got out of a year long relationship herself  and according to my sister ‘she probably isn’t looking for anything’. So as far as Mary is concerned it may have just been a one time thing to hook up on New Years; I don’t know her well enough to make that judgement and don’t feel comfortable enough to talk to my sister about it anymore cos I told her about getting attached and she made me feel like a complete idiot for being like that. Idk if it was because I was on MDMA (I know it dissolves boundaries  and you generally have a better connection with other people, the ‘love drug’, very euphoric) but I was drawn to her in a way I have never experienced before (before taking the MDMA), normally I'm sexually attracted to girls like yeah I find her attractive but that's not what drew me too her - idk how to explain it. Like a deeper connection? I don’t want to say like a soul mate, but I’ve never felt a connection like this with a person before? But then again it could be a superficial connection with the drugs. I really have no idea! Any opinions/advice/guidance would seriously be appreciated so much! I have no one to talk to about this. I got about a 1/3 way through the story with my psychologist in todays session  and it’s just eating me up inside! I want to get out of this mental rut! Thank you in advance &lt;3",2
5x8gmx,"walk, outside","Social isolation for the 4th week and I'm forgetting time. I just realized I've been home with very minor walks to a store outside for 4 weeks. I took a break this semester due to... Well, mental illness I guess. The important thing is that I have stuff to look forward to. I am going to the psychiatrist on the 7th. I haven't told my mom I'm not studying or working yet. Haven't told my friend. I never texted to my previous group I'm taking this break either. I wanted them to know but it'll be awkward now if I text them just to say bye until I join another class next year. It feels weird. It's like the next dark episode of my life has begun. I've never felt this numb before and my sense of time is literally nothing. Each day just passes with nothing. Browsing internet. Computer game before I get self-conscious and anxious. A quick walk to the kitchen before I leave (there are other tenants I avoid), back to my dorm room. I feel like I'm too passive to do anything now.",2
5yqqua,outside,"I feel far out.. And my sleep cycle is fucked. I have nothing to do, not even a job at the moment though I get paid via public support through the school since I'm on sick leave for half a year... but despite me using this time to find help from psychiatrists and stuff there's not a lot going on and it's amounted to a lot of waking up, playing a game, browsing the web, then postponing my sleep until 4-5 am and eat a lot of crap to feign enjoyment. My psychiatrist commented that though he understood my issues he did not find me to appear depressed, and it's true. I can still be goofy (although some days I feel like I'm going crazy) but really, most days is just me feeling miserable, not talking to *anybody* (I live on my own btw) not going outside and just going through the motions. I have been on sick leave since Janurary. I have not even called my mom to tell her that I'm stuck in my apartment. It's strange, because i want to be depressed so I have an excuse for not doing anything. The problem is social phobia which was already terrible a couple of years ago to the point of being debilitating but now? Now, I'm so far out I think I've developed symptoms that are way worse than being anxious around others. I still stay far away from other people I know or just people in the dormitory, which means I never cook in the public kitchen. I just feel stuck and shit, I'm wasting my time even venting this because there's so many things I want help with. On the 21st I have my second session with a psychiatrist. He already ruled out Aspergers which makes me ambivalent but I guess that's not the case, but I'm afraid he'll just prescribe me some random pills and say ""go figure it out"".

One went well enough that the girl invited me back to her place after some drinks but when I got there I freaked out thinking that she wasn't going to like me and while we were watching netflix on her bed I fell asleep. I was embarrassed and didn't ask her out again and after that I didn't go out with someone for about a year. I transferred colleges back closer to home and started hanging out with one of my old friend's little sister since we both went to the same school. I eventually got feelings for her and when I told her she said she was seeing this guy she was hooking up with. I got super down and felt like she didn't like me at all but we still hung out all the time last summer. Also after getting rejected by I decided to lose a bunch of weight dropping from 210 down to 170 pounds bc I felt self conscious about my weight. While her and this guy she was seeing weren't officially dating we still hung out a bunch one on one. She would come over to drink and then one night I got up enough courage to ask if she wanted to stay the night and she said yes. At this moment I should have thought that she liked me and wanted to be with me but I kept thinking about that time she rejected me. I also kept thinking about how to make a move but I would just get super freaked out about the whole thing because I wasn't sure how to make a move without bringing up my feelings. Yet again I was in bed with a girl I liked but could not do anything about it because the first two relationships I was in ended with my rejection by them. She then started to see that guy and they started to date each other but in February they broke up for a 2nd time. We started to hang out more after they broke up and 2-3 weeks ago we started to go out once or twice a week. We went to a bar and then went to a park later that week. About a week ago I got an invite to come over to her place and we would drink some wine and watched some netflix in her room. She then asked me if I wanted to stay the night and I freaked out again and decided to go back to my place. Since then I have tried to see her again and now she is always busy and I feel as though I fucked something up just because I overthink things. I started seeing a therapist once a month since december and I feel that she's been helping a lot with my personal life outside of relationships but I haven't really discussed anything about my love life with her because i feel embarrassed. I am wondering if there is anyone who has experienced something similar and how they went about to change their mindset.",2

I've never had a boyfriend (just short term relationship at summer camp or one night stands) and I was feeling lonely so I created myself a dating profile and met this nice guy who has a lot in common with me (same music tastes and he is a harry potter fan). We've been talking every two days on the internet and we're going on a date I guess (we met on tinder and he sent me the wink emoji a few times at the end of messages about going to a bar on saturday night) but I often get really nervous when I talk to people I don't really know, especially if that person is a guy. I become so nervous that I can't focus on ideas of topics to discuss, resulting in a lot of awkward silences. I really don't want to destroy my chances with him so I came to the internet for help (never been on reddit before) Please help me, I'm desperate...

I do meditation. I'm 17, M. I end up feeling like I can be who I want through meditation after I do it in the morning for about 15 minutes with meditation music, but every time I go out with someone I end up just feeling like shit again because I'm afraid to talk about certain stuff. It only really seems to help me temporarily and if I'm at home doing it for some reason. I have tried it outside before but being around other people basically just counteracts it because of anxiety to talk. I always ending up wishing I just force-said what I wanted to because then I would be ""confident"" and then none of this shit would be happening. There have even been times I've been so anxious before that it basically made me suicidal because I couldn't even tackle a fear that only exists in my fucking head. This is basically the definition of just being afraid of fear itself without any real context to it. I was able to feel happy just through meditation and positivity easier than this. It didn't mean I wasn't fucking anxious though, even though a couple of months ago when I was doing that, I thought it was ""normal"" to be anxious when it wasn't. I thought meditating in fucking college toilets and the local park back then with a laptop/phone and meditation music would help but it didn’t. Happiness does not fix much tbh when you stop feeling it for a while then you finally realise all the things that are wrong with you.It did make me feel better at the time lol maybe it's not ""pointless"" even if I'm not perfect from feeling it. I do hope I can still (somewhat) challenge it by going to social events(like they always say to go to) in the future even if there will always be some things I'm scared to talk about. I still do dream of being crazily confident in the future, even if it's completely frivolous to do just on its own, yet somewhat inspiring. Even being motivated feels pointless now because what exactly is it I’m going to do with it anyway?

6l9up2,"walk, sea","Up  and Out, Not Down  and In. Over the more than 20 years that I battled social anxiety before finally overcoming it, I developed the concept of “up and out, not down and down and in”. This sounds simple but it was incredibly effective. It was a little reminder I would give myself that I applied specifically to my gaze and body language in order to turn around any situation where I could feel myself becoming very socially anxious and potentially losing control and spiralling into a full-blown anxiety attack or “episode”. Having had SA for most of my life, I developed a very intimate relationship with it and one of the most interesting things I noticed about it, was that it has most power when not faced - either figuratively or literally. I found it was most potent when left to wreak havoc in that space just out of the corner of your eye or mind’s eye. That couple you can kind of see out of the corner of your eye in the coffee shop and can hear laughing, but are too anxious to turn to look at - you just ""know"" they are laughing at you. You start to feel awkward and you become certain they are giggling more at how conspicuously uncomfortable you are becoming. The book you were originally reading, you are now only using as a prop as a place to fix your eyes. You can feel your thoughts starting to race and feel yourself spiralling towards an anxiety attack. You just ""know"" they can see your excruciating awkwardness and your redness and sweating starting to build, and are delighting in it with those shrill laughs. That person you see coming towards you on the pavement. You’ve only taken a quick glance from 30 yards away, but you can just immediately ""tell"" that it’s that person that used to bully you at school. Your heart explodes and you start to feel it pumping in your neck - not just your chest. You feel sick from the adrenaline. Your head drops, your shoulders round over. Pull out your phone and pretend to take a call so you can turn around? Cross the street? Look at the ground, look at the ground, walk as fast as you can. Let’s just get through this. Why the hell does this kind of stuff always happen to me? Any of this sound familiar? In these (perceived) stressful situations your gaze drops submissively downwards, your attention turns inwards to your own racing thoughts and heartbeat, and your body begins to curl up into a defensive ball - shoulders come up to the ears as if to protect yourself from an imminent blow, arms fold across the chest and the head drops. It was at exactly such moments that I would remind myself of “up and out, not down and in”. As I felt my body and thoughts being crushed by the weight of what I believed was happening around me in situations like those above, I would deliberately push back against it. I would bring my head and gaze up, sit upright, take a deep breath and stretch as if I was uncomfortable from sitting too long, push out my chest and turn my awareness outwards. As I stretched, as if yawning, I would take a good look around the room. And when I did, I found something incredible happened... I found that these nightmare-ish scenarios that I thought were unfolding around me existed as mere phantoms in the corner of my eye and mind’s eye - in my physical and mental peripheral vision as it were. When I turned to look at what was really happening it was as if the scales fell from my eyes and I was awoken from a bad dream. Where I imagined terrible demons looming up, there were only pleasant everyday people, going about their lives. The couple in the coffee shop were a pair of young lovers, so into each other and canoodling so much they hadn’t even noticed me, let alone given a f*ck about what I was doing. The guy walking toward me on the pavement wasn’t that guy from school 20 years ago. I had just managed to project my worst fears onto him and make his face morph into someone else. Amy Cuddy has talked at length about the link between posture and mind, and I find that this “making myself big” brings about an immediate change in me mentally. It is effectively a way of striking a “power pose” and this change in physical state brings about a change in the mind and body - even changing hormone levels! It’s as if I am physically throwing off the pressure which I had been allowing to build up on me, which in turn was shrinking my posture down physically into a weaker and more submissive pose. This then becomes a downward spiral as submissive body language feeds into ever more negative thoughts...and on and on. As I look around the room in such instances or face the person I was worried about, I turn myself from a feeling of the passively observed to potent observer. The gaze is a very powerful thing and can be used very effectively in dealing with social anxiety. In the coffee shop example, as I look around, I see normal people doing their own thing - reading books, listening to podcasts, scrolling through their phones - not the rows of judging faces pointing and laughing at me that I had let build up in my mind’s eye. This technique can be used in any anxiety-inducing situation where you have enough space to avoid yourself shrinking down under the weight of your anxious thoughts. Even if speaking in public or another situation where you feel scrutinised and unable to make exaggerated movements there are still changes you can make to bring about the same effect. For example, if speaking in public you can strike a power pose by widening your stance, leaning forward with both hands on the lectern and bringing your chin up. You can also scan the room to engage people individually with eye contact. In this way, the blurry sea of judgemental “audience” “out there”, becomes individuals with their own features and expressions. I also use it a lot on buses, trains and airplanes where I would find walking past rows and rows of seated passengers while I looked for a seat very stressful. But I find this is most effective on the subway, which i historically found a very stressful and anxiety-inducing environment. The more I would be sucked down into looking at my phone or book (which i was only pretending to engage with because I was becoming anxious - and increasingly so the more I believed people were starting to notice how uncomfortable I was) the more my thoughts would race, the redder I would get and the greater the feeling of losing control and spinning into an anxiety attack was.The spell could only be broken by “up and out, not down and down and in” - looking up, posturing up and turning my attention outwards. On subway trains now I spend a lot of the time enjoying the luxury of leisurely looking around the carriages. I try not to stare at anyone as I’m sure there are many people there with their own self-consciousness and anxiety issues that don’t want any unwarranted excessive attention. But I do enjoy the newfound ability to let my gaze roam around, register people’s faces and see that no one is out to get me or laugh at me or judge me. Has anyone discovered this or uses similar techniques to deal with anxiety-inducing situations?",2

They had isolated themselves from anyone. No friends, no family. I would go outside a few times a year. That's how my social anxiety was able to develop into something that feels utterly hopeless. Is it even possible to recover from that? A few years later I developed body dysmorphia, which causes me to feel a constant shame of my appearance on top of the already present anxiety. I can't say a word to strangers, and I turn my head so they can't see my face and see how ugly I am. It's so, so awkward for me and them and makes me seem unfriendly, which is the last thing I am deep down inside. It's so frustrating. To make matters even worse, I seem to be an extrovert, which goes against all logic. Talking to people is what makes me happiest, by far, so I am in constant, unbearable loneliness and always crave company. I've lost nearly all of my friends and seem to be unable to make new ones. Even if I did, I can only meet people online and they'll be hundreds if not thousands of miles away. No one in my family understands me and they all tell me I'm a burden.

This may or may not work for you but it is good to trial and error it just to be sure. I like making some kind of eye contact even if it is awkward. I used to not make any eye contact with anyone outside and when I would come home, I would feel horrible and start to kick myself because of it. I would feel like I was missing out on life and would feel sad. I broke this habit by telling myself before going outside, "" some eye contact, even if it's awkward, is better than no eye contact."" For girls, I notice that when a cute girl comes into my line of sight I get nervous and shy away. I would look anywhere expect for them. This has been a automatic reaction for awhile, and I would feel like coward afterwards. I manually had to change this behavior. So before going outside I'll tell myself "" Some eye contact with girls, is better than no eye contact."" Last tip I can give is posture. I imagine my back against a wall when I am walking. I notice that this helps making eye contact easier and I also feel like a boss for some reason haha. I'm no pro and I still get nervous but it has got way better than a couple months back, when I didn't make any eye contact. I am 23 years old and this desire to be confident and get girls has made me want to really change these bad habits that I have had for many years.

If the hand signal is on I feel like everyone in their cars are watching me standing all awkwardly, and it's worse if there are no cars coming but there are other people with me, because I feel like they expect me to jaywalk. If I start to jaywalk and a car suddenly appears then the driver will get mad and everyone at the sidewalk will see me as some idiot who almost got killed for being impatient, even though I wasn't being impatient, I just started crossing because I was afraid of looking awkward in the event that I didn't cross and I could've because there were no cars. On the other hand... If the walking signal is on that's good and in most cases no problem, but the worst is when you only have like 10 seconds left to cross so I'm not sure if I should start crossing since I might not make it in time. And I don't want to run because in 5th grade people said the way I run is funny so literally ever since I never want to run in public lol. And if I don't make it in time everyone in their car will be upset at me and see me as some idiot who doesn't know when to cross the street. But if I decide to wait, then I just look silly because maybe I could've made it, and in their heads they're all like ""...why didn't that weird guy cross the street lol."" So what I've been doing recently is, whenever I'm not sure if I should cross or not, I sort of pretend to walk away from the crosswalk and go on my phone pretending to be busy. This way I avoid both people in their cars and other pedestrians. I'm still worried that people can tell what I'm doing, but it's not as bad as the other scenarios. Or of course, sometimes I just avoid the crosswalk altogether if there's a bridge or something nearby. I just find it very frustrating that something as simple as crossing the street is this huge obstacle for me. I'm terrified of something going wrong and my poor judgment when I'm anxious.

I was catching up with an old friend from high school. We lost touch back in high school but we still live nearby. And we reconnected the other day. He wanted to hang out. I was hanging out with another friend (19 year old) and i was like ""sure, come hang with us"" and he came over. As soon as he got there, he was like ""you're still hanging out with high school kids?"" like he was attacking me or something. we all hung out for a while and it was fine, although he didnt say much. He was very quiet the whole time. He was heading home around midnight after hanging for a couple hours. I was like ""alright, drive safe"" and he was like ""two whole years and thats it?"" My social anxiety went through the roof when he said that. I was already stressed out about him not approving of a lifetime friend of mine, and at this point I felt like he was attacking me. So i came outside to the car with him to say goodbye in private, and I asked him if everything was okay. He said ""why are you still hanging out with high school kids, man?"" I told him my friend's not even still in high school, and he said ""might as well be."" in a very disapproving, almost angry tone of voice. I'm bad at understanding social cues and stuff, and I dont understand why he was so bothered by it. I told him that me and my friend had been friends since elementary school, and I wasn't gonna quit hanging out with him cause he looks young. (he has crohns disease which delayed his puberty so he looks maybe closer to 17, but he's only half a year younger than me, and 8 months younger than him). Anyways, he dropped it after that. I thought he was about to head out, but he ended up staying and we chatted by his car for 30 min to an hour. He started talking about his job, a recent fight with his girlfriend, and about how he really misses a mutual friend of ours from high school. He opened up a lot, and it was surprising considering how he was acting beforehand. The night ended well, but I was left with a bad feeling in my gut and was super anxious. What should I do about the situation? I have terrible social skills and terrible social anxiety. I dont even know how to interpret it. I'm stressed as fuck and I cant stop thinking about it. It's making me feel sick and I cant eat, and i had trouble sleeping last night because i was up all night stressed out.",2

I just left college to go buy some lunch and when I got back I literally just stood outside the door listening to everyone in my class chatting, there’s like 8 of us and everyone else is really friendly with each other but no one really talks to me and I wouldn’t even know how to start a conversation even if I could. Anyway I stood there thinking about how uncomfortable it would be just sitting there eating in front of them so I decided to leave, got half way down the corridor and turned back, got to the door again but panicked so now I’m eating outside in the wet because it’s been raining all morning.",2
799sr6,"outside, walk","I went out alone last night, this is my report. I never knew it was this fucking hard to go out alone, lol. As soon as I hopped on the bus to go downtown I felt like I was on my way to Hell. But I had promised myself to stay outside and be social for atleast 3 hours. As soon as I came to the bar I felt intense anxiety. People sat around their tables, talking actively and having fun and I felt like a proper dickhead joining them uninvited and talking nervously. So, so, so many awkward encounters, cold approaches, trying to bum cigarettes, half-assedly asking for directions, getting made fun of by chads and even bouncers. I walked aimlessly on the steets from bar to bar, socializing as much as I could. My psyche was breaking down. Girls were super uncomfortable around me because I was nervous and boring. Around midnight I said fuck it and gave up. I walked to an E-sports bar and sat down there with a group of people. They were nice and welcoming and we talked about video games. They were boring though and I just sighed out eventually. They started ignoring me completely and just chatted with each other about boring shit. A guy that sat with his friends at another table smiled at me as he saw me sit alone. He waved to me and shouted ''Come over here man!''. This was the turning point of the night for me. I talked for soo long with this guy about a game called PLAYER UNKNOWN BATTLEGROUNDS and he taught me so much. Soon we started talking about getting girls, improving game and working out and we both became super excited to finally have found likeminded people. He said I was one brave motherfucker for going out alone and he said he wants to be my friend. We agreed to go out the next day and try to get girls. I added him on steam and rode the bus home. Now, waking up, he's messaging me on steam and we're making plans to go out today. Together. I am so excited and happy. My resilience paid off. Never ever give up. I know it's extremly fucking hard to work up the courage to go out alone and not chicken out after your first awkward social encounter, but please, for yourself and for me, don't give up. The universe will reward you for your courage and good things will happen you. Fuck me, what a long post. Very confusing I'm sure. I'm hungover so I can barely type. Oh well, I hope someone finds this interesting and helpful to read.",2
7aob9l,walk,"success story - not a boast. hi i am a 24 yo male and have had social anxiety for a while now.. about 4 years. I have never had a gf, i am a virgin and i havent been kissed.. im not an ugly fucker, but no ryan gosling either. yesterday i went out rather reluctantly with a uni friend as i had just finished my degree.. it was a uni event anyways i planned on just drinking in my sorrows and such which i did, but i was finding it kinda nice. My friend was there with her bf and her other friend. We got along rather well. Sure enough the 4 of us got bored and went to do our own thing. Her friend lets call her ""eve"" (lol) and i danced and drank a bit. I kinda broke out into salsa or similar and started holding hands with her damcing around. I dunno what was going through my mind (other than alco) but i did find her cute (she was indian or similar) we grinded a little as well and kept saying stupid things to one another about the place and i kept making sure not to charge across her boundaries but also break the touch barrier.. we held hands while dancing heaps. my two other friends left early and i took this chance to ask her to go for a walk.. sure enough we did and we ate shitty fast food on the way back to where ahe was staying.. at the top of the stairs i had to give her back her shoes (i was carrying them because they hurt her feet) i asked her if she wanted her shoes back and she said ""maybe, is that what you want?"" i said ""idk maybe its not"" she said ""maybe you want something else"" i said ""maybe i do"" we smiled and she leant in for a kiss snd i met it. We made out for a little bit and i said ""thats more like it"" we did it again and i hugged her around her lower back.. i told her that was my first kiss and she was kinda shocked.. then she told me hers and how it was weird. We kept talking and we kissed again. Then we said we have to go on a date. Then added each other on fb. I left with her and then we said goodbye. Whatever happens now doesnt bother me. I feel kinda concrete when it happened.. like i wasnt passionate enough. She was into it but i kinda wasnt because of my anxiety.. but i managed to wing the whole episode. We seemingly had a bit in common (not much of a social life) and kinda pissed with the world. We played 20 questions while eating shitty fast food and i asked if anyone ever complimented her on her eyes. They were dark brown and matched her skin. She was so cute. All this happened in a 5 hour period. I guess we clicked and we also related on similar things. I still see her eyes looking up at me while we were dancing. She smaller than me and i liked it. Im telling you this to prove that all of us can do it. I was over feeling alone but i hated it still. Im not here to boast because im not a cunt. Im here to give you a sense of hope because it is certainly possible. Never underestimate your chances. I have now joined the ranks of the users of this subreddit who have had success. Its possible. Just wait for it.",2

I went out without a drink in my system (unfortunately I decided wayyy too late I was going to do this) and so couldn't actually get in anywhere (after 2am the clubs open generally don't let you in for free, so I was stuck OUTSIDE them). I just walked the streets outside and would spark up conversations with people. It seemed like great practice and allowed me to test myself. There's something about drunk people that makes me wayy less anxious. Probably because a) they won't remember and b) I'll be nowhere near the weirdest thing to happen to them that night, so will just be insignificant. Anyone else do this? OR think it is a good idea?

7iln49,"baseball, run, outside","Cold, introverted IRL but ""easy to talk to"" online. I've struggled with social anxiety as long as I can remember. I never had many friends at school and even though I played sports for ten years (baseball) I never really got a 'social network' going. Ever since college I've more or less lived my life online. I probably spend 6-10 hours most days on the computer. It's where I get most of my social needs met, as far as that's possible. I feel like two different people living in the same body. One person is the face I show in public, quiet, passive, and unassuming. The other is what I show online, where I tend to be extremely outgoing/silly and make a lot of jokes. IRL I'm too nervous to be who I am -- a fun loving extrovert -- because of my anxiety. Over the years I've managed quite the collection of bad memories at dozens of social events where I have hid, snapped, or run away. The most recent example was a all staff meeting at work where I first went to the bathroom to avoid introducing myself to my coworkers and a half hour later had a row with one of them because of a misunderstanding. I left the meeting and didn't come back (ended up pacing outside for two hours before I calmed down enough to go inside). The internet is the only outlet I have to really express myself because most of the social pressures in day to day interaction don't exist. After sixteen years of misery (I'm 20) I'm tired of being someone I'm not, but I don't know how to be anything else. Have any of you felt the same? And how have you dealt with it? Thanks",2

I (f/20) am in a psychiatry right now (since 3 weeks), i got a bit more comfortable around a big amount of people, i don't get nervous anymore running through the hospital (its a very fucking big hospital with hundreds of people all day). I always prefered to be alone, i accepted the fact that i LOVE to be alone. Sometimes when i'm alone i feel lonely, but when i go outside again i realize how fucked up this society is, i am more comfortable when i'm alone, i don't need anyone, i was always isolated, introverted, and without friends my entire life, why should i change that? I can't miss anything i've never had, and just started to accepting it and get happy with it and done. The only thing the psychiatry helped me is to not to overthink so much like ''what random strangers might think about me when i walk past them'' so yeah, that's 1 good thing. But the other thing pisses me of so much.... i. can't. fucking. talk. I never talked to my parents, i never talked to anyone, seven hells, even my psychiatrist knows more about me in 3 meetings than my parents for 20 years and i'm barely able to talk to her, 'cause i don't know what the fuck to say, i have nothing to say, my interests are space, history, really old stuff no one knows shit about or doesn't care. Other than that i play games the entire day or watch movies... But nothing interesting to talk about with others at my age... Soo. I can't hold a conversation at all, i can't start it and things get weird pretty quickly. I guess that's what most of us get through. So how do i break it? My only motivation? lmao, i am pathetic. My only motivation to change is because of another girl that works at the psychiatry as a student and i, well, how can i say this? seems like i got a fucking crush on her and it makes things WORSE. I've been trying to act normal around her which works surprisingly good, my self control is at 100%. But i still can't talk, i just want to talk to her, she is so fucking nice and i don't want to mess it up...Things got worse, now i don't want to be alone anymore AND don't want to be around people, this shit fucked everything up even more for me... I get so fucking nervous when i try to talk...I always say to myself ''why can't you be normal? none of this shit matters, if you don't talk to her you will never see her again after you get out of the psychiatry so just fucking talk, next time you see her say ''hello'' and be done with it'' i go back immediatly to do it but then i freeze up the moment i see her and can't open my mouth because the fear is literally eating up my ass. What the fuck am i supposed to do? I am watching a bunch of Hayley Kiyoko videos right now, they help me a bit to get more comfortable lol...maybe it helps some of you guys too...dunno...do normal girls even want to be friends with a weirdo patient like me? fuck this....",2

7n3nw0,walk,"I'm just reaching breaking point now, I'm so lonely.. Ok, so, I'm a 24 year old man who has never had a girlfriend, been on a date, kissed, or even held hands. And it makes me severely depressed. All I want out of life is a soulmate. Everything else to me is secondary than to have someone to love and be loved in return. I'm a quiet person, I don't go out clubbing and drinking, I quite frankly hate that, the problem being I don't know where to meet girls my age. I know even if I went out drinking/ clubbing I would not find the kind of person I would want to be around at all. I know what kind of person I like... quiet, like me, someone I can talk and laugh about anything with and just be myself and they can be themselves. Up until the last year I didn't really think about this, I wasn't an adult, I was more bothered with messing around with my friends and doing my uni work. But now I feel really empty, I know I just want a woman in my life. I've missed 2 opportunities where the right person came along in the last 6 years to be with girls I liked because I didn't realize I liked them until it was too late and they had already found other guys (like soulmates) I know I was immature and didn't realise what was happening. Nowadays I know that wouldn't happen but both of these people are long gone from my life. Over the last year I've been constantly using tinder, plenty of fish and okcupid, but no results at all. Tinder is the least successful as I have only had 2 matches, ever, it's 90% not my type of women anyway. PoF and okcupid have more of the right types of people on there. But the thing is, I'll always message first, 7 times out of 10 I will get no reply, and mostly if I do they stop replying in like 5 or 10 messages, and I've only had 3 connections that I thought were going somewhere but all 3 got to the point of me asking them on a date and then going through them just saying they weren't ready even though I'd only suggest going for a walk in town or a cup of coffee and a chat. I don't know what I'm doing wrong there. I don't know where to meet the right kind of people in real life. I'm a freelance animator and that isn't very social at all. And my other job is part time in a pound shop in my home town (I still live with my parents simply because I cannot afford to move out at all) and I don't really meet people at work. Besides if I saw a girl I liked at work I would not know what to say. I'm terrified of looking/sounding creepy so what happens is I just can't even make eye contact let alone say anything. I'm not ugly, I'm not an asshole, I am nice to everyone I meet unless they are unpleasant to me in the first place. I don't know what to do.

I usually walk to college. It's 30 minutes of brisk walking, kinda far but not really. Can't use public transport because there's no direct routes, and the closest bus route actually takes longer than just walking. But a bit too close to drive to everyday. I don't mind, I like walking anyway. This time, however, I was out of town before class so I came with a car. After class these two dudes started asking me some questions about the class and they said they are heading in my direction. I thought they were just going to take the bus, so I was like okay whatever, they're just going to go the other way after that corner, it's just a two minute detour. But no, what they actually meant was that they were going somewhere near where I live so they were going to walk with me. After I realized this I didn't know what to say so I just thought fuck it, walked all the way home, pretty much to my doorstep, (actually took far longer than it usually takes me, because they walk very slow and I couldn't use my shortcuts). Then I looked around to see if they're gone, then I walked allllllll the way back to school and got the car, then drove back home again. Like what the hell, seriously. Worst part is, these two guys are the only two people I dislike in my entire class. They talk shit about everyone, just extremely unpleasant hateful individuals. They probably think I'm like them because I don't talk to other people much. I don't know how to let them know I'm not. Whenever they invite me somewhere I tell them no, but they still persist.

I'm afraid that they think I'm some sort of pervert for looking, and if I talk I'm terrified they know I like them and think I'm only after sex, but what I really want is a meaningful lifelong relationship.. But I have a severe longing for a partner... I've tried every online dating app under the sun for the last year and a half and have had no success. Tinder, I've never had a match.

I'll just send a first message with just a greeting and asking them how their week is going... I hate talking through just messages because I can't get my intent across, and I can't interpret the intent of others. I want to meet girls face to face. But I absolutely hate drinking, bars and clubs and ""going out"" I like video games, movies, art and nature. I don't know where to meet girls my age who I'd like.

Unfortunately because I live in the UK, free therapy is of terribly low quality (just some random person who doesn't really know what they're doing) and I only get 6 45 minute sessions because there is barely any government funding for this type of thing.

Sadly, I am about as stubborn as anxious, which has lead me to some pretty dark times. There have been worse moments in those six years, like waking up to police kicking down your door to bring you to a psych ward, my mum not letting me inside the house for 2 days to make me tough and my anxiety disappear, thanks for that. Or when I was being put in a home for disfunctional children, but ran away again and again, hiding in a forest and shit. I am living in my small little apartment and haven't interacted with anyone for four months. Except my mum, who is caring for me, which is honestly very nice of her. But you can tell she is about to cut off contact. Anyway, today workers had to come to fix something in my apartment, the first time someone besides me or mum was about to enter my apartment. I couldn't handle it. I didn't sleep yesterday night because I was feeling so on edge and didn't eat today yet because of the stomach ache my anxiety is causing. I asked my mum to come and be here when they come so I could get away. You could see the moment she realized I am still an anxious wreck, if not way worse. She refused to drive me to her place, so I had no place to stay at. So I grabbed her car keys and got in her car. What I am trying to say is that I basically sat in a car for four solid hours today, because the workers didn't say exactly when they'd come. And guess what. Last minute they called my mum letting her know they couldnt make it today and they'd come back in the next few days. I am pathetic. Plus my mum screamed at me because she doesn't understand. Kind of bummed my suicide attempt last week didn't work, good thing nobody noticed tho.",2
84oqkf,"walk, hill","Stepped far outside my comfort zone today by stepping into a classroom setting for the first time in my life.. My local community college had a preview day today. As part of a New Years resolution, I decided I was going to start saying yes to events instead of being cozied up at home all the time. I should note that I’ve been homeschooled through K-12, hence never having walked in a classroom. I won’t lie, I was really nervous leading up to, and partly during the event. I played some indie folk music on the way to try to soothe my nerves. As soon as I pull my car over the hill with the intersection, I witnessed just what I’d be getting myself into. Cars were everywhere. It was a real turn out. There were over 200 people in attendance. I find a parking spot at another building, and I’m just thinking of home. Home where I don’t have to worry about sounding stupid or accidentally having a social faux pas. I push out my chest and walk towards the line. I wasn’t expecting a line. So I mozy on to the back of the line, occasionally looking at my phone so I would blend in with most of the high school kids that were there (I’m 19 with a full beard who is out of the loop on current technology). I couldn’t get a WiFi connection, so I was just switching between settings and the browser the whole time, hopefully looking like I was doing something. The line crawls, and I’m just switching between looking up and at my phone. I make it to the walk up registration, and tell them my name and what not. It seems like it went ok. I walked up and just found the quickest seat I could so I wouldn’t have to be seen walking up by everyone. I sit down and immediately this dude asks if I play vidya games. So I tell him I play fortnite. He starts asking if I watch this particular twitch streamer, I say no. The conversation kind of fizzles out after. Wondering if I seemed boring? Moments later I hear him say to one of his friends “you want to get drunk later?”. At that moment I’m having a little bit of a culture shock. I’ve never drank alcohol. Does everyone booze in HS? I felt kind of uncomfortable. Finally the presentation begins. It’s pretty basic, and I could have got more information from the website. There is a point during the presentation where they play this website quiz game from the school. I can’t partake because my WiFi won’t work, so I just watch the results. I would have got most of them wrong if I tried. Yikes. I was taking notes, but not paying attention to the right stuff evidently. So after that, the whole room is being split off into tour groups. I am paying full attention because I don’t want to screw up and go off with the wrong group. Thankfully I do get the right one. At this point I’m standing alone with a bunch of strangers. Most are with someone else. The tour seems to go fine, there were these three really obnoxious teenagers who were fucking off for the most part though. They didn’t bother me thankfully. Our tour ends and it’s on to the last event (which I wasn’t aware of until later.) Its basically a few different stands promoting different fields of study and social events (almost none of which pertained to my major of choice or my personal interests.) I talk to a few of them anyways. I won’t lie, it was really awkward. I kept tripping over my words, speaking in broken English, and my mind went completely blank a few times while in the middle of conversations. I honestly wonder if this hurt my chances of being enrolled. I didn’t have many good questions either. Afterwards I sat at a table and fidgeted on my phone, then I realized it was for the most part over, and a wave of calm came over me. I realized I could leave! Since I didn’t have anyone to talk to, what was the point of staying any longer? So I walked a long walk back to my car and headed home. That was it. Only part worth it was touring the campus honestly. Well it wasn’t a perfect attempt at integrating into society, but it’s progress nonetheless. I’m proud that I did this instead of wondering what it would have been like at home. It was awkward and I didn’t connect with anyone. I’m afraid more will follow when I do (eventually) enroll there. I just thought I’d share his with anyone of you who is afraid of getting out of the house and in public. I still feel like an out of touch geriatric alien, but hopefully I made some progress. **TL;DR** Went to a preview day at my local community college. Walked into a classroom setting for the first time ever. Had awkward encounters with recruiters and faculty. Glad I went anyways.",2
84zq43,outside," Did anyone else grow up isolated?. Growing up I wasn't allowed to watch movies rated higher than PG or play games rated higher than E. I remember that for movie days in class, my parents often wouldn't sign my permission slip. I also wasn't supposed to watch ""bad tv"" like Spongebob or the Simpsons. I wasn't allowed to have a cell phone until like eighth grade, and even then it was a shitty flip phone in the early years of smart phones. Coincidentally we also didn't live around any other kids; the school bus didn't even come to our house. My parents would still force me to go outside sometimes when they felt I had spent too much time on the computer (no internet of course), even though there was literally nothing for me to do except maybe throw a frisbee at my brother who is four years younger than me (a huge age difference for a preteen). My parents weren't narcissistic or religious nuts, maybe a bit overprotective, but I feel like the rules they had for me prevented me from making friends in my early development, which is of course a very important time to make friends. And what's worse is I think they relaxed their rules for my younger sibling, and now he's in high school and from what I've heard he has lots of friends and does school sports and other extracurriculars. I would not be surprised if he has his first relationship before me (maybe I shouldn't think this way, but the day that happens is the day that whatever meager self worth I have will be extinguished).

8agwdx,"outside, walk","Has anyone else experienced this or something like it?. This is gonna be a very long and personal post to an extent with some background detail for clarity. Hopefully someone will read through and offer some advice or likeness. Okay, so I have been someone who suffers from social anxiety since I was about 8. Before that I was actually very outgoing and was social at my preschool/first grade/second grade. Many things contributed to my social anxiety and thus my life long battle of depression. The first notable thing was my teachers bullying me for having ADHD and telling me I was too disruptive. The second notable thing was my best friend in second grade ended up ignoring me because the popular girl in the class disliked me as I was very active and bubbly. So, that's some backstory, and ever since then I have been an internet recluse. Everytime I tried to make friends they used me and then bullied me verbally and mentally until at 13 I quit going to school and outside completely. Internet gaming, specifically MMOs is all I've had since. Fast forward, I am now nearing 22. I go to college, have a job, and a boyfriend of nearly 5 years. Everything on that aspect is fine (or better than expected for now) but...I fucked myself over socially. When I was 16 I made a friend group despite my social anxiety. The internet is easier to socialize on for me, even though I still can't order a pizza over the phone or make a Dr. Appointment irl. I've had these friends since 16 for a very stable period, but last year I had a complete social anxiety attack and went haywire. I removed everyone, blocked them, and vanished for 2 months. I tried to come back and explain what happened, but no one was having it. One friend who was very close, even responded ""lol good"" when she heard I was struggling. I tried to reach out people to ask why I was being treated this way and they would get mad at each other for telling me something and then I got backlash for trying to reconnect and put the pieces of my social life back together. This has been extremely debilitating for me and I have relapsed to my pre-social ways. I apologized and told them I'd stop bothering them, to which they never responded to except that they didn't need the drama. What bothers me most is that to make these friends, I put myself out there and listened to when THEY were upset. I specifically remember two of them were genuinely suicidal and I talked them through their troubles. One of them said she won't speak to me because I am only trying to talk to her because no one else will and I need someone. Well....yeah. Is this not what normal friends do? Anyways, I apologized to them all and removed them because I was only a bother and annoying. I keep having small breakdowns and it's leaking out in my relationship and work. Today at work the assistant manager seen me act very atypical and asked me if I was okay to which I kind of laughed in a hollow tone and said no and walked away. Everyone at work noticed and I started having an anxiety attack mid rush (I work at a pizza place so it can get work heavy on weekends). What do I do now? Has anyone else experienced this and has found a way to cope or just experienced this in general? I want to make new friends...but I just feel like a teen again and like everyone hates me. TL;DR: I was social for awhile, had an anxiety attack, got isolated, and now I have nothing. Anyone relate?",2

I pushed myself to do it and it went really well. She was super friendly and we've been chatting back and forth for the past few days!! I was also [anxious](about collecting donations for an organisation I volunteer for. I just got back from doing it, and I'm pretty proud of myself. We were outside a supermarket so there were lots of people coming and going. We managed to collect a good amount of money, and I managed to make small talk and thank everyone who donated. It sounds small but this was a huge step for me. I was so anxious about these things but I managed to push through it and do them anyway. Feels great to have a win over my anxiety ",2

I'm 21/male but my sister, who's just graduated, invited me to go with her to her friend's graduation party because she felt bad that I'm always alone. I stood around awkwardly for a while eating caramel popcorn and then spent like 10 minutes staring at myself in the bathroom mirror lol. Following this was a series of short, awkward exchanges and a sudden wave of sadness. I didn't last but another 10 minutes snacking on popcorn till I ended up outside sitting behind my sister's car browsing reddit on my phone.. I really envy the people who can just walk in and be super comfortable/friendly/talkative and have a great time. The girl hosting the party came to give me a hug and I about started shaking. Wtf is wrong with people like us lol. The only way I can feel comfortable is with alcohol (I fucking love alcohol for this reason) but I wouldn't right drinking in front of my sister. And even then, it's like I'm not myself anymore once I'm drunk, and I want to be social AND be myself, u kno? Anyway, so here I am after the whole ordeal feeling hella worse. Idk, are there any 'cheer yourself up' thoughts anybody has for times like these?",2

I want to get a part-time job to start earning money and buy my own things and start contributing to my college expenses. However, I struggle with anxiety. I lived a very sheltered life. I never really had any friends and I spent a lot of time in my house. I didn't go outside too much. I used to get bullied a lot as well. My father growing up was very critical, harsh, and judgmental of every thing I did. He would always give me a hard time on being so shy. When I'm in public or around strangers, I get nervous. The only place where I feel most comfortable is my house. It's so irritating because this anxiety is holding me back from getting a job. I want to get a job in customer service, because I think it could help bring me out of my shell. But I get nervous of the thought of having to interact with strangers. What if I get nervous talking to a customer and they can tell, and they think I'm weird? What if I'm awkward interacting with them? The thought of my coworkers, customers, and manager observing me and judging me is difficult. How am I going to get through the interview? What if I can't think of an answer to a question? I'm afraid I will make a lot of mistakes at work and make a fool of myself. I'm also a huge people-pleaser. What if my manager won't like me? What if my coworkers won't like me? What if a customer gives me a hard time? I hate that I let my anxiety build up to this point. I always had it but it was never this bad. I need a job because I need money. I'm sick and tired of being broke! I'm sick of being stuck in the house. I'm sick of having to rely on my mom and dad for money like I'm a freaking child!

I would say this is one of the biggest things that I struggle with for social anxiety. I've had this problem for the last six years, and I've made little progress with it. I always feel like people don't like me that much or think I'm weird or nervous and a weakling. A lot of times when I go out with my brother or someone, the employees or other strangers almost always acknowledge my brother or whomever else I'm with instead of me. Even if I'm the one making a purchase! Like if I'm making a purchase with a cashier or my brother and I are talking to someone, the other person only makes eye contact with my brother and talks to him as if I'm invisible and not there. It frustrates me when people ignore me. Why do people favor my brother over me? I'm not a bad guy. I'm a nice guy. Or when I'm out for a walk with someone, and a passerby only says hello and smiles to the person I'm with and not me. I remember another time I was out to eat with someone, and the waitress only greeted the person I'm with and not me. She said to my friend when she came to our table, ""Hi how are you today?!"" completely ignoring me. I wish I could get back to the point where I didn't care whether or not random strangers like me or talk to me. This problem makes it hard for me to go out and relax without worrying about people's approval of me and whether they like me or not. I didn't always have this problem. It stemmed from when my 8th grade history teacher didn't like me and pretty much ignored me the entire school year. He acknowledged all of his students except for me. That experience traumatized me because I was usually always my teacher's favorite student, and that was the first time I've ever been treated like that by a teacher. And I still haven't really recovered from that. I'm trying to overcome this, but it's so hard. Any advice would be appreciated.",2

Just recently I have been trying to invite myself into a group of a few children, they seem to welcome me everytime. I say hello, sit/stand in the group but I dont say anything else. Whilst they are talking away, I cant think of a word to say, i struggle to even keep track of what people are talking about. I find speaking with adults hard, but a lot easier. I may sound stuck up saying this, but i find almost all children my age immature. Most of their jokes I don't find funny, and I am not interested in their childish conversations. Most of them are around 16 years old. When I tell most people I am 14, they are very suprised. Ive had a few people over the internet guess im 19-25 by the sound of my voice. When someone asks me in person, they ussually thought i was around 17. I almost find it to be a chore to even join a group of kids my age. Im very interested in history, and science, I could talk anout black holes all day! Unfortunately those sort of things dont seem to interest them, nor do they even seem to understand it. I havent had an actual freind since the 3rd grade, I'm about to be in 10'th. It sounds like an exaggeration, but most days I am stuck in the shitty apartment doing nothing but watching youtube all day. My parents would rather not let me outside because (boy your gonna get raped and they gonna chop ur dic off). Yea, im sure... I have tried reaching out to my parents for help, but they tell me its fine. LIVING LIKE SHIT WITHOUT EVER TALKING TO SOMEBODY OR DOING ANYTHING AT ALL IS NOT FINE! When i say I can't do anything, im being honest, i honestly spend the entire day watching youtube because i can't do anything else. I just need help learning to talk to people. I see some of them griping about how they wanted to kill themselves because they had to spend a whole day inside the house, boo hoo little bitch, try spending every day like that. I can't relate to any children my age. I dont play any video games or watch any shows, and I don't use social media, as I have no reason to. I go to an online home school, which does not help my case. The children I try to talk to are ussually from church. Any help would be great.",2

When I’m out with family I order off the kids menu because that’s all I like, unless there is just chips on the adult menu. That’s kind of embarrassing on a date. I don’t like the cinema or any time of play/concert etc. I find it too loud and I hate the fact I can’t just get up and do what I want at anytime or leave. Things like concerts are also out of the question because they’re also too over whelming for me and I don’t like being around drunk people. So obviously not drinking and also being 19 is a problem because that’s all teenagers seem to do. I don’t like pubs or bars or parties. I also feel embarrassed when I say I don’t drink.

Thing is no one my age wants to do that stuff and I feel embarrassed to say I don’t like it. That’s even if I get comfortable enough to want to go on a date anyway.

I’m feeling a lot of pressure over this one interaction bc junior year was pretty lonely at times and I want to have some deeper friendships during my senior year. I’m looking for advice both on how to master my anxiety and how to talk to someone who I don’t know a lot about. From reading other posts the common advice seems to be listen instead of worrying about what to say next.

Now Im sure it isnt just puberty. Today I went to the store to buy a new pair of earbuds, mine broke and listening to music helps with my anxiety. I was on foot and during the 7 mimute walk to the store I was starting to get sweaty, I was thinking what to say to shop assistant and I was afraid of someone recognising me and I had to make a small talk with them. I get to the store, a big one inside a mall. I get there and the first thing I see were the earbuds, but they werent those that I wanted, searched and couldnt find the earbuds that I wanted, I wanted to get as quickly as possible so I grabbed one of those and headed towards the counter to buy them. The shop assistant was talking to 2 women and I was afraid of interrupting them, I give the earbuds to another shop assistant that was next to the other shop assistant that was talking to the women. He was doing something else but I put the earbuds on top of the counter without saying anything, the guy saw that I wanted to buy the ear buds and gave them to the lady that was talking to the women. The woman was slowlying writting on the keyboard with 2 fingers and talking to the women, during this, I was sweating and shaking, and I was looking at the store, I saw the earbuds that I wanted on my right and I had missed them when I was first looking for the earbuds. I take one of the earbuds and placed them on top of the counter, the shop assistant didnt see the earbuds that I wanted on top of the counter, I had to talk to the shop assistant that I wanted to change the product, few words, was quick and quiet while shaking and sweating. She did what she had to do and I took the money out of my wallet shaking to give the lady. I put them in my backpack and walk, almost running to home thinking that I was way too akward and that they saw me shaking and sweating, got home and started writting this.

The whole room goes dead quiet and the person who threw it said ""I thought that was the end of the school."".. Que laughing. I just don't understand it. Is it because I wear a black hoodie? Because I want to stay warm in this freezing school, that makes me a school shooter? Is it because I'm quiet? Because I literally cannot socialize because my stupid brain runs through every single horrible possibility of what could happen? Does that make me a school shooter? Because I want so so so badly to have a friend or people to talk to me like a person, but my feelings and brain won't allow it? It almost makes me cry every time, and I know that makes me feel like a baby. All through school, ice had things like paper, clay, and even shards of glass thrown at me. I've been physically beat up on the side of the road walking home as people in their cars watched. But its only the school shooter statement that really hurts me. I never wanted to hurt people. I hate having people scared of me. If they're scared of me, they'll never talk to me. I hate this.",2
9m22jd,outside,"Anxiety attack during a party and had to leave. I’m currently sitting outside near my car, waiting to sober up, because I thought I could enjoy a party if I drank a lot. Nope. I really don’t understand the appeal of not knowing anyone in a crowd of 30 people, trying to make small talk and dance around. I really don’t understand it. I can still see the house and I see people dancing in the windows but even though I tried to have fun for over an hour, I just became increasingly more anxious and sweaty and stressed out. It’s so frustrating. I tried going to a party at this house last weekend too; I know the people who live there well enough to hang out in a small group and have a great time but I can’t stand being there during a party. I try to follow the few people I know around but they wander away from me and I get stressed out and that makes it even harder to relax and talk to new people. I wish I hadn’t tried to drink to make myself have fun because I’m gonna have to wait a while before driving home. At least I parked across the street! Last weekend I lasted about 10 minutes and this time I lasted over an hour, and despite feeling socially inadequate and extremely stressed out, I think I can accept that big parties just aren’t good for me right now and I don’t want to waste my time and energy just to feel like this. I do wish that I could fit in an enjoy it but I can’t. I really wish I could have fun and talk to people. I felt lightheaded and terrified the whole time I was in there. Ugh. I just wanted to vent while I wait to sober up. Thanks for reading!",2
9rtyn8,"outside, hiking, biking","Everyone hates me and what I've learned from it. This is going to be a weird post and hopefully it fits here well. I never thought of this as a social anxiety, but it actually is kind of, correct me if I'm wrong I'm new to Reddit. I've been hated. Even since preschool. Not by my family by all means, and people liked members of my family by the way. It seemed like people only outside of my family hated me. Strangers, classmates, coworkers, anyone I came into contact with besides my family hates me. I was always the quiet one and the weird one. I never minded either. I fed off of their hate. Anytime I got bullied I would fight back. Like you know when they say fight or flight? Yea I was the fighter. I would lash out and do exactly what they did to me. Or I would cry and show them exactly how it made me feel right then and there, almost as a joke but filled with rage. I didn't really get embarrassed. I was really good at doing embarrassing things and be okay with it most of the time. I preferred to be alone. I never liked it When people tried to become my friend. Like why are you texting me and calling me? Please leave me alone. For some reason I did actually become friends with the other unliked kid. I would see people snicker at them and see them as weird. Here's a little story: There was one girl in middle school. Her name was Jane. She had long black hair, pale skin and bright hazel eyes. The kids were literally afraid of her and thought she was weird I wasn't afraid of her and I was fascinated in her. I also felt empathy for her. I could relate to her of being unliked. End of short story. Weird part about enjoying being alone is I've always had a boyfriend since the beginning of high school. The boyfriends were always cool and well liked by others. The boyfriends were all similar in their own ways, we all broke up mutually, calmly and on good terms. The boyfriends all gave me respect, friendship and trust. The cool boys always liked Jane as well and she always had a cool boyfriend too! Other boys thought we were the ""funniest, raddest, coolest, best to be around"" chicks out there. Or so they say. So I guess what I should have said in the beginning of this entire post is, most girls hate me. So truth be told, not everyone hates me. This has been a lie for my whole life. I believed as a small child up until early adulthood is that everyone hated me was far from the truth. One day I had enough. I tried to kill myself. Slit my wrists and wanted to bleed out. Well it didn't work, I didn't die and I should have gotten stitches. So I decided that day I will never try again left with awful scars. I still hated my life and the fact everyone hated me. I fell again in these ideas I created. Sure there was hard proof for people hating me. They hated the way I looked, the way I dressed, my hair. They spread rumors, they prank phone called me, tried to best me up. I had a girl send me a 10 page text message saying I lie about every story I ever told her . The words this girl said to me hurt me deeply. I cried and cried. I worked with her and I had to face her. I was terrified of her and I wondered ""why me"" It was a pattern. Some girls simply just didn't like me. There was nothing I could say or do any differently. You might be thinking, ""there has got to be a reason why people hate me."" The only thing I can think of to answer that thought, would be that I am totally myself. I don't sugar coat shit. I'm honest and I like to share ideas and past expieriances. So here is a little description about me to paint a better picture. I try hard with things I do. I really enjoy practicing different skills and hobbies that strike my interest suddenly such as painting, playing instruments, gymnastics, yoga, hiking, biking, dog training, cooking, singing and more. If something interests me I try it. You could say I'm a go getter. At the same time I'm laid back, I'm quiet and a keep to myself person. Other times I am wacky and weird. I sing and dance to myself, I talk to myself. I do weird things. I make jokes and I laugh at things. I am over the spectrum of things. I am ever changing. I am confused but I am aware. I am always looking around me and thinking people are planning things. I avoid people. Other times I truely care about people. I love people and I love seeing their talents. I want to get to know them and I listen to them. I always see people and notice their intentions. You could say I am observant. But all of this I still enjoy being alone. I guess I live a balanced life. I'm also a Libra and my life seems to match up to those horoscopes most of the time to also paint a picture of myself. So instead of rambling on and on and on as I'm surprised if anyone is even still reading this, I'm going to get straight to the point. I've learned a lesson in life and it is difficult to grasp!! The lesson is, no one actually truely cared about me all along but myself. It was me all along that cared too much about what people thought. It was my reactions towards situations that hurt me and made me think people hate me. I have to come to terms that I am simply an imperfect human being with odd characteristics as everyone else! We are all so unique and in our own little worlds. We all work differently and that's how we all fit together just as a puzzle and how each piece is unique and all work together. Sometimes it takes a while for the pieces to come together and sometimes they seem to fit but they don't really work well and you can't actually fit them perfectly. Sometimes different pieces in the puzzle need to be as far away as possibly to work perfect and help complete the picture. It is okay to not get along with everyone but when they show their dislike I need to keep calm and carry on. What I mean by our own little worlds is, everything around us is determined by our own judgements and the way we see things around us. We all see things differently, our brains work differently and you can clearly see we are all different so that proves our own little worlds. We all automatically look out for our own well being. So my whole life I was thinking too hard about what people thought of me. Once someone expressed their slight 2 second care about me, my reaction made me believe that everyone hated me. It was a delusion. I had a chain reaction because once I believed everyone hates me my actions and reactions more than likely changed that held characteristics that are easy to dislike by other people. Hopefully out of all of this rambling is that I can continue to realize these thoughts of mine and start to have a better attitude towards life. I hope I can bring light and new helpful ideas to the world. I strive to be the best I can for myself and others. I will react to others even when they do me wrong as a calm and collected individual. I will handle my fight instinct as a normal human in complete control. I will continue to just be myself and let others be themselves.",2
9ruo58,outside," Did your parents ever put a lot of pressure on you to make friends?. Growing up my father always put a lot of pressure on me to make friends. He would always ask me, ""Who do you talk to in school? Who do you hang out with in school? Why are you always alone?"" He always tried to encourage me to go outside and play with other kids. He would get very hostile and say things like, ""YOU'RE ALWAYS ALONE. EVERYTIME I SEE YOU YOU'RE ALONE. YOU NEED FRIENDS."" He would always tell me, ""You're only young once. You need to live these years to the fullest."" I had friends in school, I just never talked to them or hung out with them outside of school. I didn't live in close proximity to them. But talking to them in school was enough for me. My father wasn't in school with me so he had no idea what I did in school. I had friends in school, I had my siblings, and a few cousins who I would spend time with. That was enough for me. Even to this day my father asks, ""Are you making friends in college? Are you making friends as work?"" I understand his concern as a parent, but I just think my father put way too much pressure on me. Can you guys relate? ",2
9yg2p9,"running, walk, park","My most recent experience. I'm making a mess out of this recent situation I have going on. So I got in an university about a week and a half ago. My classes started this past week and I still didn't go a single day. Last Monday I just felt like I didn't want to but in reality I was just running away like I always do. Tuesday I left my house with the intent of going but about midway through I just started panicking and instead walked around the city so my family didn't start suspecting of anything. I swear I never walked as much a I did that day it was pathetic, and all because I'm afraid to go to class. That was when I decided that I wouldn't go at all that week and instead I'd prepare myself and today I'd be in a changed man an all the fear and anxiety would be gone. Late night Sunday the same disgusting feeling started going on again. Heart racing, this awful feeling on my stomach where you are completely comfortable on your couch yet it feels like something isn't right... I go to YouTube and start watching the same guys again and again trying to get this awful feeling out of my body, trying to find some sort of miraculous solution for my problems. Today I wake up, leave my house to go to school but each stride makes me more and more anxious. I create all these movies inside my head ""How will they react, Will I be accepted What should I Say, Will they talk to me, What I they ask me a question...."" so, like last week, I just didn't go again instead I'm typing this in the sort of park while listening to music. This same thing happened to me last year too, i spent about a week going to university and turning back last moment without entering the actual school room because I was afraid of what I'd find out The worst part is that I'm breaking the trust of my family who thinks I'm being an adult and being responsible. Im 25 years old, I'm ""studying"" in my city, what am I afraid of? I don't get it I know that once I eventually break this cycle I'll look back and think I had nothing to be scared of, like I said the same happened to me last year and after going things went pretty smoothly. I know taking action is the most difficult part and I get inside my own head way too much. I don't know what I expect by making this post. I know it all comes down to me and me only at the end, there's no Jordan Peterson, no Robbins, no random YouTube video that is going to help me, any exercise that will help me. I guess I hope to find someone to make myself accountable, or someone who went through the same or maybe I hope that by admitting to someone my situation I'll see how stupid I'm being. Anyway this is my most recent experience",2

a2cjun,"beach, outside","I have no friends and I feel lonely. * Post is going to be long and thank you to anyone who actually reads all of it Okay so I’m 19F and I have no friends. In high school I had 2-3 really close friends including my main best friend lets call her BFF, and a bunch of other friends mainly just people I talked to and hung with in school and class but was never truly close with. So my bff and I were super close all of high school until about the end of march when she basically ditched me for a new group of friends she made. We would still talk and I was her “best friend” but once she started hanging out with her new friend group she never included me, stopped telling me about important thing going on in her life, etc and overall just acting really snobby and conceited. I ended up confessing to one of the other girls I was really close with what was happening, and she was by my side and supported me. My bff and I ended up talking everything through and were good but things didn’t really change. She kept hanging out with them at all times never including me and when I did hang with them (once) she barely spoke to me the entire time. After we graduated she had two weeks in our city before she had to go away and start summer semester at a college far away but still in the same state. She spent the whole two with her new friend group and only gave me one day to hang out 3 days before she had to leave. During this time I was at my dad’s house and was so pissed that she would do this to me that I was not going to leave my dads house just so she could see me when she had all this time to and didn’t. Summer goes along and we didn’t talk not even once. At this point in my life I had decided to start school in the spring to give myself some time because I felt that I needed it and my only two friends were the girl that helped me out with my bff and her best friend who was also my friend. The entire summer we barely hung out. After summer we hung out a couple times but they were all super boring. I’m personally very outgoing and a hyped up type of person when I’m around people I feel comfortable with. They would just sit there and not want to do anything fun or engaging. I don’t mean get drunk and party all night, but like go makeup shopping or play fun stupid games, go out to eat, talk about boys, go shopping, go to the beach, or in general anything besides like going to one of their houses and playing nintendo wii. Plus on top off all this they were very judgy and would look at me weird for saying something outside of the box. When I would ask one of them about the boys in the college I was going to go to in the spring she would be dry and uninterested. Then in October I got a job, and I really like the place I work at. When we would hang out and I would try to tell them about the people and like the tea going on at work they didn’t care and I would talk and they didn’t respond and I felt like I was talking to my self. All of this plus the fact that since they were each others best friend they wouldn’t include me in a lot of their convos and then bring up things when I was there made me feel really lonely and tired. Eventually was broke the camels back was that drama basically started again with my bff and when I texted them I was just going to text her and end this once and for all they both started sending messages like “oooohhh can’t wait for the tea” or “🐸☕️”, “the tea it hot” and in general things like that. I was so offended because instead of being there for me and supporting me bc they both knew how hurt and emotionally affected I was from the situation between my bff and I all they cared about was the tea and the drama. A month after this happened I cut them off but only talked to one of them. It was the one that helped me in the beginning with my bff. I thanked her for supporting and that I was always going to be grateful for that but that our friend ship was over and I explained to her how they made me feel and basically she texted me back cursing me out and saying a whole bunch of rude shit and I never texted her again. Both of them blocked me on all social media platforms and I have not seen, heard, or talked to them since that day. I started college but online bc I have no transportation to campus so I have no interactions with people my own age and at my job it’s mainly middle aged women and a few young people but not anyone I consider to have a good connection friendship wise with. It gets me so sad to see my ex bff on social media going to parties and having fun, making friends, etc. when I wish I was doing that. Plus just in general watching young people my age having fun and hanging out with their “squad” makes me depressed! Because I want that. Now because of my friendless life and because I have little to no interaction with people my own age in over a year I’m beyond scared to do school on campus so I’ve decided to do all of college online. I’ve definitely gotten a lot anxiety in regards to being social with people my own age and also boys. I’ve never had a boyfriend or even talked to anyone and with my whole lonely no friends no social life situation I’m never going to meet one and if I do, I mentally I’ve already sabotaged myself because I think to myself how embarrassing it would be to meet a boy and when he asks about my friend me tell him that I have none. Like how fucking embarrassing and lame does that sound. So to avoid this Im just not gonna let any potential guy get close enough. Plus I’m insecure about my body bc Im a little chubby but don’t do anything to change this because I have zero motivation. So far the only good things going for me are my job, school, and my immediate family. I get depressed when I think about the fact that I’m so young and I have no friends anyone to hangout with and have normal social interactions with. Like am I really going to waste all of my young years stuck in my house all day and working as much as possible. Sometimes I think that the best I can do is graduate and keep moving up in the company I work for now and become a workaholic and live with my parents until forever. Sorry for this long ass stupid rant. Goodbye Im sad as fuck now low key crying and depressed:))))",2
a2fpbs,walk,"Confronted a friend that I thought hated me.. drunk. I will start with; I was at a party yesterday. I suffer from social anxiety disorder and I've had the oh so typical social anxiety thought that people hate me lately. I have a specific friend who my attention has been on lately because he really doesn't talk that much to me, almost forgot to say hello to me when he arrived to this party (even though that's probably not true, alot of people there to say hello to) I know for a fact that this is like the nicest guy that exist in the world, but my brain is a wierdo so.. Should also add that he is a few steps above acquaintance level. There had been some quite heavily alcohol intake from everyone at this party and sometime during the night me and a friend decide to take a walk around the neighborhood and he decides to come with. I tell my friend about this feeling about him hating me (2nd time, have talked about it before and she says that's not the case). This situation ends up with me deciding it's a great time to tell him how I feel. My friend ends up telling him that I feel this way with my permission (He also doesn't know I have anxiety or any problems btw). He then comes over and of course tells me that's absolutely not the case. I suddenly break down crying and hyperventilating in his arms and we talk it out as best we can (we are alone at this stage). My friend then gets back and in my drunk state I pretty much word vomit out a confusing summary of my history with anxiety and my current state to them. We keep on walking the three of us and he keep comforting me with kind words, small hugs and back touches until we arrive back at the party with me now close to anxiety free. I'm now a little confused about this. I'm honestly glad I told him, it feels like it got rid a little bit of the whole thought about people hating me. I also feel guilty that I brought another person in to my anxiety. I sent him a message this morning apologising about that he had to see that and that I put him in this position, and he said everything was cool and I believe him. I honestly thought I would have more anxiety about this but a big part of me just laughs at this whole situation which is wierd. So this is just a little bit of a vent from a hungover girl.

a3d5um,"walk, outside","How do I [21/F] be comfortable around boys, not be nervous and start a conversation?. I've known a classmate [24/M] since 4 years now. He's seriously a nice guy; asked me to see him *face to face* in college (I'm saying because I can't talk face to face with boys..), asked me to see him after class, texted me he was looking out for me after exam, sends hundred emojis in text, asked me to video chat, invited me to a city rally, invited me to watch him play guitar, sends me pictures of the place he's visiting, asks me if I want something from that place, sends me pictures of himself (and his mother, I don't know why mother too), suddenly sends me a picture of a cut on his hand he got when he was playing guitar and captioned it ""love bite"", posts my text as his status on WhatsApp, last night (out of the blue) sent me pictures of his wins in PUBG. We were sitting in a room, he's a coordinator of the committee and he walked past me and stood beside my chair. All this when I don't reciprocate, at all. I'm always nervous so I just act like I'm least interested and come cold. The one time I hit back was when I said it was ""a loss"" for... a girl he's had a crush on, and he told me about that, and he proposed her and she rejected. I don't feel anything special for him but I do notice his l behaviour which seems confusing to me. If he already has a crush, why's he trying to crush me? Well, but, my problem is that we've not talked beside texting, although we're in the same class but we don't talk in person. I realise that he wants to talk, but I just have nothing to say and no confidence to begin, so I just sit and hope I get crushed under a rock. Anyone sane in my shoes will take this opportunity to reciprocate, gel up, hangout and see each other. His ""crush"" is pretty outgoing and talks to boys and girls, so everyone in general, although she's not very friendly, but l come off as boring, nervous and clueless. I'm pathetic, but I don't want to be. Who knows if I actually talk to him in person instead of just texting him, we may develop some emotions, but I can't put into words how blank and awkward I feel. I've lost so many opportunities by coming across as uninterested when boys I knew gave me clear signals of their interest, but in my defence I was enjoying my life and not involved in premarital relationships, thus being moral (I'm quite conservative, don't judge), but now I'm old enough to be in a relationship with a decent man and marry him if all goes well, I'm not kid anymore, but, the fuck, I act like a kid because that hides my lack of confidence. I was raised in a small town and wasn't allowed to talk to boys, I've always kept some distance from men, so it feels like approaching a whole new specie! We were writing an exam today; his friend and I were in the same class. He came to our room after exam, looked at us and tried to tell a joke. Went outside, and looked at me for a while from the entrance. When I went out of the room, he was standing outside alone; him and I saw each other and... I rushed back into the classroom and walked away with a friend. I wanted to talk to him, I don't know if he did really stand there for me but he was still alone, and I missed him!

I hadn’t even realized Id been looking down the entire time even though i was trying to make eye contact. I was basically stunned the whole time.

Then I slowly began to feel lonely and making new friends wasn't an option im always uncomfortable and nervous when i talk to strangers and i know that i have like really low conversation skills i avoid it because I know i will fail.

Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been super shy. I don’t know why. Nothing happened to me as a child, I have a great family and have great friends so I don’t know why I have this debilitating issue. I looked it up, and i learned that sometimes people with an overactive amygdala have a heightened fight or Flight response therefore causing more severe anxiety. So maybe it’s a biological thing for me, but I have thought of anything at all that could have affected me to be like this but nothing comes to mind. Throughout middle school, I haven’t even realized but In seventh grade I was depressed. I don’t think I knew it. I knew I was sad but didn’t know if it went further than that. I don’t remember being suicidal then, but seventh grade was the first time I started to self harm. I was always getting in trouble with my parents, I’ve always felt like they’re out to get me and I never show or receive any affection. Because of this, me and my parents relationships is not the best. and I know it’s my fault. They try to understand why I act certain ways but I don’t even know myself. I wish I had an answer. So anyway, an incident happened in seventh grade where I had to share something with the class. Presentations always scared me and being in front of the class always did. Even if it was a simple yes or no question. I can’t stand being the center of attention and I always cry when I feel this social anxiety coming on. We had to share poems we had written and I just remember being so scared, I just started crying and couldn’t get through it. I remember my classmates faces and they were so confused and I was confused to. I knew it was just a presentation but my body had another idea. To this day I’m not sure if that was my first anxiety attack? and I’m not sure if I’ve ever had an anxiety attack because I never feel like the world is ending I just get so embarrassed I think, that all I can do is cry and my heart starts beating rapidly, and I’m shaking and I just wanna disappear. But do people have anxiety attacks differently? If you know, please help. Anyway, after that happened I was SO mortified I didn’t even want to go back to school. I always assumed people labeled me as the super shy freak girl and wouldn’t want to talk to me anyway so I decided to do virtual school in eighth grade. No one knows that’s the reason I decided to be homeschooled. I just tell everyone “I don’t know just felt like it” when they ask because I don’t want to tell them my embarrassing story. So virtual school actually turned out to be awful and so I ended up starting high school for 9th grade as a freshman. Because I skipped out on 8th grade, I already didn’t have many friends. And the ones I did have, lets call her Lauren. She was my absolute best friend and we ended up having a class together so that was the class I looked forward to. I remember always being isolated in my other classes while everyone else talked and I would be so scared around people and scared that someone would talk to me. I didn’t have many friends that year. I also repeatedly cut and I was developing an addiction. Come sophomore year, I was deeply depressed. My best friend, still Lauren, she glew up. She became popular and gorgeous and it was hard being friends with her sometimes because she had so many friends and guys all over her. I know it wasn’t her fault of course, and through it all she stuck by me and I couldn’t be more grateful to have someone like her to this day. But I can’t Help but feel inferior when I’m with her sometimes. I would always think “people are probably wondering why she’s friends with you” “they just think you’re a charity case” I was so quiet all the time. I honestly don’t remember much of sophomore year. I just remember being sad all the time. I remember drawing sad sketches. I discovered and became obsessed with twenty One pilots, (still my favorite band today and I’m seeing them this year FLOOR TICKETS! can’t wait haha.) so come junior year, I told myself if I wasn’t happier by the end of the year I would kill myself before senior year. I met my other best friend junior year and we are so similar it’s crazy. So greatful for her friendship. Still struggled with self harm. I started to maybe get a little better, or so I thought I was. I got my first job at Burger King, which was not the wisest decision. Smoked weed and got high for the first time. Developed a huge crush on a boy who did nothing but lead me on. It really wrecked me and I don’t think he has any idea of how much to this day. Pierced my nose. I think I kept trying new experiences to feel something, convince myself to stay. I thought it was working but deep down, I was the same. Didn’t self harm as much because it wasn’t as easy to hide anymore. And my mom found out a little later and everything just got a bit crazy. Forced into therapy and parents found a pipe and new I was smoking. They were absolutely furious. I also was caught with a boy over at like 2 am by my mom. Not my finest moment. I think this was definitely my most impulsive year. I started to do things that scared me and that I knew was wrong but I think I was just trying to fill the void I had. One night I decided I had enough and tried to overdose on vistaril. I remember feeling the effects of it and becoming super tired so I thought that was it. I went to bed peacefully. Well, spoiler, I woke up. I was so mad I hadn’t taken enough but I think I was also relieved. I read about liver damage and all that and I decided that if I was going to do it again, I would take enough so I wouldn’t end up in the hospital impaired all my life. So summer before senior year, my best friend, Lauren, invited me to a church camp. I’ve always been a Christian and such but never had a relationship with God. That camp was a turning point for me. I met so many people and developed so many friendships and it opened my eyes to a life I wanted to live. And for the first time, I felt like I had support. People who were there for me and like I had God. But my depression still didn’t go away. I was still sad. So so sad. One of the hardest things I’ve ever done, is opened up and told my feelings of depression and suicidal ideation to. One night at the camp, it was the last night and we were all in this big room sharing stories or just venting things we needed to get off of our chest. Telling people things we needed prayer for. I told everyone In that room, maybe 60 people, my plans of killing myself. How I was going to before senior year but that this camp changed my mind. And I could barely get through it without crying. After that, a lot of people came to hug me and tell me to stay strong and that they were there for me. It was an amazing and cool experience. But I started attending church with her and becoming stronger in my faith and I connecting with amazing people. I went to Guatemala in 2017 on a mission trip and it was an amazing experience. Everything was as good as could be. I just wanted to be done with High school and done with my past there. I was ready for college and what life had for me. I can’t believe it, but I was dare I say hopeful. I felt guilty for being anxious and depressed as a Christian though. It of course, was no where as near as bad as it was but I still woke up and felt that same emotionless i felt for so long and tiredness. Soon enough, I just accepted it. People think that because I have Jesus now that I’m okay. But inside I am still hurting and depressed. I think about suicide almost everyday but I would never act on it. I know God is there for me and would never want me to do this, his plans are always greater. And I believe that, I do. I went to Montreal on a mission trip this past November and it was awesome. I love helping people and showing gods love and although it’s hard to connect with people sometimes due to social anxiety, i know I’ll get through it. But still depression lingers. I worked at chick fil a for a bit but quit due to anxiety and the amount of people there and all. I try daily to get back up. I need a job but I’m scared to get one just to become over whelmed and quit again. I keep letting people down. I still want to die. I wish I could just go peacefully. I feel like a ghost among the living and I’ve always felt like something Is wrong with me. I’m on meds and I always dream of overdosing but I could never. I have a tattoo dedicated basically saying “this may suck but God’s still got you”. It’s “And if not, he is still good”. I got that tattoo and wrote my testimony about having social anxiety and living through it. I feel like a hypocrite for feeling like I want to die still. I always encourage others and tell them that it does get better and to hold on and I hope they believe me when I say it and can’t see behind my mask. I think I believe it when I say it to them. But for some reason my mind makes me believe that I will never succeed and I’m bound to live a purposeless life. Everyday I wake up and I say just another day to exist. Just doing my classes and occasionally meeting up with friends. I feel like I’m lying to them. No one knows how I feel am I’m ashamed to tell them. I don’t want them to take pity on me and I don’t want to treated like I’m going to break if they touch me. I am in a new relationship. My first boyfriend, and he is the sweetest most amazing thing. But I’m scared to tell him how I feel. I warned him of my depression and anxiety but I didn’t tell him the extent of it. He doesn’t know I self harm. Which I did for the first time in about 6 months yesterday. He saw and I told him it was the cat. Lame excuse and I don’t think he bought it. I’m torn between scared of telling him and him not wanting to deal with this or just tell him because he was going to leave anyway. either way I lose. it’s best to be honest right? Anyway. I know this is super long so thanks for reading if you did. Any comments / suggestions / advice is welcome. Thanks. By the way I’m 19",2
aid6bh,camp,"A different type of social anxiety. As I get closer to my 30's I have mostly shaken off the most inconvenient aspects of SA. I can now ask for directions, make small talk, be vocal in class (I'm a student), things 18 year old me never would have believed. However, I have yet to work through the biggest hurdle, groups. I *cannot* integrate into groups for fear of being rejected or worse, mocked or ridiculed. Growing up, in various situations (eg. summer camp) while people slowly started to form alliances and friendships I was always the person left standing alone. I chose to isolate myself as a defence mechanism, and still do to this day. Now I'm convinced that I've missed out on crucial social skills, and the older I get, the lonelier it feels. I imagine others view me as a stuck up cunt, especially since I look the part of a ""normal"" person. I believe my dad took his own life due to the same feelings of loneliness and isolation I'm experiencing. Some days I feel like checking out too. TL;DR: I think groups will reject me so I stay away.",2

al6bds,"forest, walk","I had a norminal conversation with a cute cashier. I was going from my therapy late at night and I saw this little bakery still opened. With worries mounting I have decided to try venturing in to explore the dungeon. I have entered the store and a really pretty girl greeted me politely. Likely because I was so tired that evening, my brain lapsed and forgot to flip on the anxiety engagement switch. So I had a quick glance over their selection of cakes and I went on to ask about whether they had any with cherries. She said no, but we have a tasty forest fruit mix cake. I was like ""that's the next best thing, gimme 2 pieces of that"". She smiled, got me my cake and said they have a special discount so late at night. I paid and wished her great evening. It all went so fucking smooth. I did eye contact, smiled, asked a question...no anxiety. I felt high as a kite walking home. 🙂 It was so rare. I wish everyone such an experience!

apljky,"outside, bike","My story. Includes social anxiety, body dysmorphia and incel. English is not my native language, so u can read some weird words. I will try to ´´summarize´´ this (at the bottom, there is a real summary). As a child, when i was around 11, i was really attractive to everyone. I know this because at school, i got all the girls chasing me, and so outside. Obviously, i was too young to ´´benefit´´ on this. At that age, i remember myself as an outgoing kid, that had friends and did some regular stuff. Later on, something happened. I think that the inflection point was the haircut that i started wearing, the classic mushroom haircut that a lot of kids wear...with the difference that i was a teenager already. From being a young Adonis, i started to hear the mock of some girls, through the nicknames that they put on me, refered to my haircut. All my friends started having some interactions with girls, while i was just staring, too afraid of rejection. That was the beginning of my fearful existence, and it continued (with ups and downs) until my current age of 25. So yeah, right now i feel like i didnt live at all. I never had a girlfriend, i only have 1 friend that i meet every few months, i never had a job and never been to a party. This decade has been a mix of playing World of Warcraft, doing sport (cycling and calisthenics, obv individual sports), and studying some random useless shit that my mother suggested me to. I feel like it doesnt matter what i study, since there is people in almost every single profession. Ive studied hostelry and quitted it cos its too customer-facing. Ive studied sport and physical activity animator...but it was only because i like to practice it, im too insecure for teaching or doing anything in fron of a group. Now i switched to programming...but seems that im too autistic even for the nerd-world, since the teacher already told me that i have to learn to participate more while working in a groupal project...but i just end up excluding myself. Sport is what saved me through all this time. When im at home, i cant stop thinking about the past and the future, and i listen a lot of depressing music. So i need to take a ride on my bike almost every day. Im prety good at it and its hard to think about random shit when you are under big physical effort. I consider myself a good interlocutor, but i only can show this in individual conversations. In a group (specially if i dont know the members), im unable to articulate a single word unless someone ask my oponion directly. This is hard for me, because everybody that ever meet me, told me that im a very witty person and i can contribute to the conversation. Im really quick at making word games. Somebody once told me that i should try rap battles. And i would...if i could articulate a fucking word in front of groups of strangers -.-º. Because of this witty personality, i know that people want me in their groups, and i got invited to random plans and parties many times...but always refused. I just cant stop thinking about little details that throw me back: what if i have to dance, what if they wanna take photos, what if my clothes are not suitable...And so, for me, saturday is just another weekday to play WoW and do some sport... I once challenged myselft to go to a psychologist. Since the first session was free and it was one to one conversation, i thought i had no excuse. It went pretty well, she got really interested in me, because we talked for an hour and a half (the session had one hour) and she even invited me to come for another free session and to pay whatever amount i could for the next ones. Not to vary, i rejected... As to relationships, ive always been on this dating webs, but it has been useless because my profile photos sucks. I hate being photographed, i dont want to recognize myself on the pics(i think im much better in person) .I always have the same 3 pics from a specific angle and blurry. I consider myself pretty good at flirting, but if the profile pic is not attractive, u wont get the chance to start a conversation. And so, i didnt meet a single girl this way. Well...i actually met one. It was on a social anxiety forum. We exchanged numbers. I could see her picture, but she couldnt see mine, so everything was ok xD. She was really pretty, which surprised me(even more, when i discovered that she had like 1k followers on IG). We chatted for a week straight, it was amazing. One day, she asked me to meet in real life, which is really hard for me, but after those conversations, i thought there was feeling between us, so i accepted. We met in a bar. She was really beautiful irl, but not as perfect as in those IG pics, which i liked even more. At first, we were kinda nervous, but the beer made its effect and we talked for hours.It was getting late and she suggested me to pass the night in my house. Im naive, but i think i know what this kind of proposition means...Still it was a terrible idea, cos i live with my mom. Dont know how and why, i ended up accepting. Before arriving to my house, i thorowed up(cos i smoked, and that makes me sick most of the times). Once in my house, my mom woke up...Well, we ended up sleeping on the same bed, but nothing could have happened cos i was too wasted X_X. Surprisingly, she wanted to keep meeting with me, and we met one more time, a few months later. The most remarkable about this one, is that we kissed. It was a really quick and cold experience, so i dont even consider it as i ever kissed. The fact that she kissed me (obv it was she who went for it) without passion, meant a lot for me. The next day, i told her to break up, because i was getting feelings, and she told me that she only was looking for friendship. She insisted in meeting again, but i rejected. That was the last time i had something with a girl, two years ago. And this is how i learned that u cant have social anxiety and 1k followers on IG by posting pics of your body. Ive cried a lot after that break up, and now im again on that numb state that everything is bad, but not enough to cry... How do i know that i have body dysmorphia. Simple: because im the supreme textrovert. I feel very secure when it comes to written comunication (more on my native language). I consider myself good at flirting (i know how to tease) and i use to troll a lot (even whole groups of people), specially the people that cry about their situation or blame others. Everything is ok as long as they dont see a picture of me. One really strange thing is that, in videogames, i never been able to speak through a microphone, which is a requirement for doing a lot of fun stuff. So i ended up being a loner even in videogames. Add that to my completism (im obsessed with achieving everything that is achievable in the games (and irl too)). Overall, i think i have a really great body, specially because i practiced several sports for more than ten years, Im 1.85 height, 70kg with very lean muscles and long legs. My hair is of an amazing quality and my haircut now is an upgraded version of the mushroom style that i think began everything xD. It makes me look younger. I dont like a lot of things about my face, but i think it has some personality. And down there, im slightly over the average. On the other hand, lets talk about what i dont like and what keeps me locked in this mental prison. I dont like my short arms, it makes me feel inferior in some sports (i feel like i have to be the best in everything). I actually started thinking that people with short arms are doomed, or something like that :/. I dont like my nose and how it looks when i smile (thats why i never smile in photos) I dont like how my hair looks when its wet, and the fordyce spots on my lips. I got the fordyce spots down there, too. They are harmless small white sebaceous bumps under the skin. Despite being well endowed, i focus more on the spots and the form of my D, which i dont like neither. Ive been watching porn for more than ten years, and it changes yourself physically and mentally. I cant stop comparing myself to the men that appear on the videos. I know almost everything about my conditions and my ´´flaws´´, because ive been reading shit about them for too long. The conclusion is that there is no magical solution, u just have to accept yourself. I read a lot about spirituality, too. Thats why i know that my goal in this life is to trascend this extreme identification with the body. To kill the ego, to live in the moment...but God, its been more than ten years and i didnt perceive much progress...I even know the techniques (meditation, self love affirmations, etc), but i end up thinking about the bad things. I still have hope, tho, and dont even contemplate suicide, because i would have to learn the lesson on the next life. Jesus, its tooking me the whole weekend to write this...with huge breaks, of course. Im such a perfectionist that i have to think a lot before before writing a line, then rewrite it...and i dont even like the final result. If you made it here: congratulations, you really deserve a prize xD! Here is the summary of this bible. I feel that i have a lot of amazing attributes, Physically im very fit because ive been practicing differen sports for more than ten years. Ive got a strong personality and witty sense of humor, as people say. Im good at flirting, too. But i just can show it. I isolate myself every time, reject invitations to social plans and let go a lot of chaces. I do this because im terrified of other peoples judgements, specially towards my body (in the supreme textrovert). Im very insecure sexually because of the classic fordyce spot issue. Now the real questions. Does anyone identify to this? Did anyone overcome a similar situation or have any advices? Do anyone wanna share his story? Thx 4 reading!",2
aq1qog,"outside, walk","What is wrong with me. I'll try to keep this short. I'm 25 and I currently live in Brooklyn. I've been here my whole life with the exception of college. Speaking of college, I have a bachelors degree in English (I know) I am currently unemployed and my last two jobs were in non profit academic advisory roles. I was pretty much a loner and hated school throughout life. I was taken to a therapist when i was 12, and they declared I was ""normal."" I started questioning life in college and realized it was pretty useless and that it was school and work until you die. I drank liquor i would say the normal amount for a college student. After graduating, I took the two advisory jobs which I hated both jobs due to anxiety. I am not a people person in general and I would sweat profusely when talking to students or even in mildy hot temperatures. I sweat 10x more than others even in the winter. I would sweat in a crowded subway or platform or talking to new people. I spoke to a doctor and I was prescribed robinul and told I had hyperhydrosis. The robinul works so that part of my life is solved temporarily. In addition to this, no matter what allergy medicine I take or what dose, I drip water from my nose and eyes. If I go outside especially in the morning, and its sunny or windy, my eyes water. I get acid reflux and heartburn from tomato sauce, coffee and liquor (all things I love). I also find myself getting extremely angry at the simplest things (people walking slow in the city, etc, to the point where I think about attacking someone in my head.) When I began feeling suicidal at my first job after graduation, I spoke to a therapist again who once again told me I was ""normal"" a ""regular new yorker"". At this point I am at a wits end and speak to another doctor who prescribes me zoloft and other downers. I mix them with alcohol in a excessive amounts to cope with the job I hate. I stop taking the zoloft pretty because they didn't work for me. I was taking to a hospital where people told me i was a handsome man who had things to live for and sat next to a girl with 16 cut marks on her arm and a guy who wanted to start fires with his hands. I did my research before hand and I realized that they would probably give me shock therapy (I don't know how that would help) so I pretended to feel better. Fast forward to today, I am unemployed living off my parent. I work out about three or four times a week, I am about 5'11 195. The only problem is I have little to no appetite daily and I am starting to develop a belly. I eat maybe twice a day (where i force myself to eat),I sweat like Patrick Ewing in the fourth quarter if I don't take robinul and i work out 4 times a week So this is unexplainable to me Anyway, I've had ultrasounds, endoscopy, colonscopy and the gastro doctor stated I was in perfect health and the only theory he has is ibs. As you can see, I've had a long series of issues in my body and doctors telling me everything is fine and blah blah etc. So I'm at a wit's end. I also have gynecomastia in both nipples and it's another obstacle that is annoying to deal with. I'm unemployed so I have no insurance to see any more doctors and i just think life is bullshit and I don't want to deal with it. I have a girlfriend, who helps me want to keep living, although she keeps alluding to marriage in kids which I'm vehemently against. The only people that stop me from slicing my wrist's are her, my mother, aunt, brother and 3 or 4 friends.

I chatted with her for a week before I met her. She had asked me out, but left it to me to decide what the date would be. I suggested coffee, but she told she'd prefer a walk first. So we took a walk across the park, during which we built up a good rapport. Later, we went to grab a bite and visited another place for ice-cream. My dumbass self forgot that she was not comfy in crowds, and I suggested going for a music fest with a huge crowd for a second date. She then finally told me about her SA, and how it made her avoid crowds, and that she's about to start therapy for it, soon enough. She also told me that she wasn't used to dating, and that having a romantic figure in her life made her feel a bit anxious because of the uncertainty. I'm very glad she was honest with me about it, and I am willing to support her through her SA(obviously I don't want to be her therapist). What dates would be perfect for someone with SA? And how can I make sure that she feels comfortable around me as well as how can I be as supportive as possible?

b3yakj,"garden, outside","I literally CANNOT talk to another person.. I will try and keep a very, very long story as short as possible. So here goes. I have never been social, having only a few friends my entire life. I've always had bad social anxiety. A few years ago, my father died. I was a university student at the time and just locked myself in my room, living nocturnally and only operating when everyone else was asleep. I would go months without talking to anyone and ended up failing university and dropping out. So I moved back home with my mother and have lived as a complete shut-in for almost two years. I literally do not leave the house, I will sometimes go in the garden but no further. There is no need. Now I am just incomprehensibly socially anxious. I cannot answer the door to the mailman when he delivers parcels, or even talk to people on the phone. I realised how bad this was and had to ask my mother to book me an appointment at the therapist, which she did. So I prepared to leave the house to go to one session and when we arrived, I could not talk to him. I uttered my name and said hello and then just started crying. I just couldn't think of anything to say. So I just ran outside and back to the car. I'm a 23 year old man. This is pathetic. What do I do, please.?",2
b4g4ws,outside,"Small steps matter!. Every year, I set a big personal development goal. This year, my goal is to be more social, put myself out there and improve social skills. I created an action plan so I can break my journey down into manageable steps and the first step is to start studying outside of my bedroom; go to the library and be around people. It is nothing fancy, but I was always going straight back home after lectures to study so I was very rarely interacting with anyone (even if it is just eye contact) and on some days where I had no lectures, I’d be home all day on my computer. This made my social anxiety worse. Almost every day for the past 1-2 months, I have started going to the library and sitting amongst strangers which is something that always made me anxious. I could have easily put my laptop in my bag and went home – but I didn’t. Not only am I able to focus more and get work done but I am also moving forward in my social goal (no matter how small). I used to wonder if people were judging me and watching me for just taking my laptop out of my bag or my revision notes (even though everyone in the room was doing it). **And, this is a big one**. For the first time, I left my laptop and notepad in the library whilst I took a break outside for fresh air. People didn’t steal my shit! **People aren’t as scary or untrustworthy as I have often thought.** These are the first steps I made for myself and after a while I will start getting out my comfort zone and be more social. Although I am not really talking to strangers yet, I still feel I am making progress. Next up, I will be attending some workshops to try and meet people. And overtime throughout this year, I will start learning to small talk with strangers; smiling more to strangers; making phone calls; volunteering; initiating conversations rather than standing alone; asking a girl (multiple girls) out so I can finally get started as a late bloomer in this dating world; and I might even travel on my own. **Small steps matter.**",2
b57qtf,"run, outside, walk","My ultimate guide for defeating social anxiety. Hello, I’m a 16 yo male and this is (and probably will be) my only post on this Subreddit. Recently I discovered something great, and I want you to read this post because you’re probably struggling with social anxiety dominating your life like it used to do mine. Remember that „you were born into“ a society. You were raised with patterns to follow. You are scared of breaking these patterns. Scared of breaking out of society. Scared of being rejected by it. Now I want you to differentiate between SOCIETY and HUMANITY. Society is a theoretical construct. A mindset. Society is what has these rules that make you scared of being yourself(„don‘t dress differently“, „don‘t run outside when others see you“ for example.). Humanity are people. Humanity are the people around you and the people you meet. The construct of society and these rules shall not apply for now. In my school bus is always this guy. He enters as one of the last. He‘s probably as old as me. He wears plain black clothes and tries to avoid any eye contact at all. His eyes are dead. When he sits on his seat he doesn‘t even put off his bag from his back. He doesn‘t want to make noise and come off as annoying, even though the bag taking all his space clearly makes him uncomfortable and it bothers him. This guy is affected by society. Not just affected, it‘s dominating all of his actions. Of course noone would give a f*ck if he would just put off his bag, but he still has his made-up rules carved into his mind. This applied to me aswell. Perhaps you may have seen by now that society cares, but humanity clearly doesn’t. Now at one point in the last few days I found a point: „What if I disconnected from all of this?“, „What if I didn‘t care?“. Whenever I am in an anixious situation now, for example walking past a row of cars, I tell myself: „These rules don‘t apply for me now. I‘m free now.“ I‘d like to show you another example. When someone mocks you for being an idiot(let‘s say you just stumbled and fell) and you care about it, you may feel like an idiot. Even worse, you let the bully take control over your emotions. You let him take your soul. Now what if you simply wouldn‘t care? He‘s the idiot now, He keeps mocking about you. But he keeps mocking a god. You are way out of his league now. You don’t care about his existence and his words. Instead of actually feeling like an idiot and feeling he deserves the right to mock you because society says that, he‘s just being a rude child now and you don‘t have to worry about him at all. He‘s still trapped in his little society cage, and you‘re a free and respectable human now. Perhaps maybe you may still think that ignoring society patterns may make you an outsider, and make you end up as a lonely old man/woman without having ever been loved. Think of the most confident man/woman you know. Think of someone harassing him/her. The confident person would never even let the harasser close to affecting its emotions. It doesn‘t have any emotional investment at all in the people around it because society doesn‘t have it caught in its chains. Perhaps maybe the average society-affected person will not like you now, but it will respect you. On the other hand, humanity will not only respect, but love you. Once you disconnect from society you will start to attract many great new people. And it‘s way better than being in the society hole where you have to show heavy commitment everyday in order to not be rejected. I want you to disconnect from society now. Break the patterns, break the barrier. Be comfortable and confident with yourself. This movement doesn‘t take any realistic commitment, I just needs a change in your mind. When you feel anxiety in your actions, don’t care. I don’t want you to demonstrate that you don’t care, I want you to not care. There’s a big difference between showing and doing. You can still be a respectable person and respect other people while not giving a sh*t about the rules of society. I hope I have helped you with this. Keep going. P.S. Since this is my only post here I‘d like to recommend you 2 great books which really helped me on my journey: - „Models“ by Mark Manson (I originally bought this book to be more attractive to women but the book guides you through a internal development too. I highly recommend this book to women aswell) -„Can‘t hurt me“ by David Goggins (This book changed my life)",2
b8tn7q,"park, walk","My first date was an absolute nightmare. I'm 25 and never had been on a date before because my SA is so bad, and now I see why I avoided it this long. There is this girl I like at work and I had my co-worker ask her to exchange numbers with me because of couse I couldn't do this myself. Then I waited for her to text me because of course I couldn't text her first. Then I managed to ask her out over text because I couldn't do it in person despite seeing her at work. Anyway, so to do the date itself. We went to this park with a trail and she brought her dog (I thought that would help, but it didn't) and it took about an hour or so to walk it. This couldn't have been any worse because all we could do for an hour is walk and talk. Now to where it all went downhill.. She had to lead the entire conversation, there would be long pauses of awkward silence and when I did talk it would come out completely different than I would have wanted it. Oh, and I couldn't make any eye contact so it was like I was ignoring her the whole time.. I had planned to take her out to eat after but that never happened and we just called it a night. She basically told me straight up she didn't have a good time. The worst part is now I work with her so I actively try to avoid her because I am so embarrassed. I know this was long and probably nobody is going to read it, but I feel so depressed and wanted to share this with somebody, anybody.",2

While my parents (and everyone, including my classmates) were inside eating I went outside and waited until we left. Now that I think about it I think I didn't even say goodbye to any of my classmates.

Then there is to get willpower to fight that SA beast.  and#x200B; I had this doctor, therapist or what to call him and he recommended me to stay in the place he worked in, it had this extra care/service place for people with other diagnoses, mental problems. I did not have any of those but he recommended I used this to get social practice daily. Staff there helped me to get out several times daily when I was used to nothing like it. I got much better, my SA turned out to a much better level where I dared to go outside by myself (I always needed a caretaker with me where ever I went outside my home). At the same time I waited for my own apartment (it was planned to be given to me right after I came out this mental care place but nope..) and having this level of SA I thought ""eh, I'll just wait for that apartment"". It took around 6 months and I did not know my SA level would drop through time. With that long wait my SA level had dropped to what it used to be. It was hell to move to this new place, it was right in the middle of town. I did not even dare to get my mail which was in this safe in the main room. If I had maintained my SA level I bet I would have dared to, and maybe even made a friend there. This was in 2014.

I get the willpower to fight. I want to live that amazing life I dream of. To have friends, to wake up knowing I'm living a life on my way to work or school. So I've made my own challenge list. From easy, middle to hard. I completed a hard challenge and it made me feel great, to know that I can beat what I fear so most.  and#x200B; I live isolated, I don't dare to talk to an internet friend I've had for 10 years, I have no irl friends, but I recently went to the cinema by myself.

I've been unable to function normally in social situation since I was like 8.

Then when I was 11 we moved house and got a computer. At first I just played the normal kids games but when I was 12 I started using sites like tumblr to express myself because I saw a lot of people on there who also had social anxiety or who were generally socially awkward. I got validation through likes and comments on social media so I didn't really make an effort to put myself out there irl because I didn't want to risk the rejection irl. Looking back now though, I realise that I shouldn't have depended on social media for my social interaction and I should have actually gone outside and tried to talk to people to build up my social skills. Now I'm fucked because I'm 18 and have the social skills of an 8 year old girl. Then again, I don't know if I actually would have improved my social skills without social media because I might have stayed in my shell irl anyway. Idk. Does anyone relate to this?",2

After an extremely awkward encounter (what other kind are there, especially when my brain is this fried after my last exam) taking a group photo for some people who had just finished. I started walking home and one of my coursemates mentioned he was going to the pub next to the exam hall, didn’t think anything of it. As I was walking home, almost at my door, I came across two of my friends with another guy and they said they were going to the pub and after a brief pause one of them asked if I wanted to come. I realised that was why my other coursemate was going to the same place and my mind instantly built this narrative that they didn’t tell me about it because they didn’t really want me there and only offered because they bumped into me, so I declined. Maybe it’s a good thing I did as I’m knackered and would have found it very had to socialise, particularly with lots of people. But I’m not even sure that whole story that fell into place in a matter of seconds is even true. Maybe he just forgot to let me know they were going to the pub and offered when he saw me? But he did know I had that exam so surely he would have told me before if I was wanted there. It’s very possible it was intensional. I hate this constant confusion. I could be drinking a beer in the sun but instead I’m in my room I avoid so many things because I don’t want to be in a situation where I’m not really wanted there because of my social awkwardness. And the more I do this the more socially awkward I get. This obviously doesn’t put me in a good place for when I (very soon) leave uni and have to go to job interviews and stuff.

We all have the same interests in games and we met in our early childhood days of starting to play video games. I am 15 years of age, and my dad always wants me to turn my computer off at 9PM. When it's left on past 9PM he usually gets really mad which I find stupid because it's summer. I know I shouldn't stay up to 1-2AM which I don't want to I just want him to stop getting mad over stuff like that. He normally says it's because I spend a couple hours a day on it. I go to the gym daily especially over summer. I just don't know what's a good way I can maybe convince him that it's maybe time for me to be able to control my own sleep schedule? Do you guys have any good ideas how I can accomplish this? I had a therapist who told me I should stop being scared of my dad and be able to voice out my opinion and even my mom tells me that. It's just hard because his attitude makes it seem like he's going to get mad over me mentioning it.",2

c5c6c4,beach,"Social anxiety holding me back in both personal and professional life. Hi everyone, this may be a bit long, but I appreciate anyone who reads even most of this!  and#x200B; Anyway, I'm a 24 M living in a big city. And a social anxiety sufferer. My social anxiety isn't physically crippling or physiological -- my physical symptoms are usually pretty limited -- but it's mental and I am an expert in avoidance. I would even say I am a \*very\* social and outgoing person in ""comfortable"" environments (alcohol, bars, sporting events, with friends or people I trust, etc.), but when it comes to ""uncomfortable"" environments including putting myself out there and being alone doing it, I avoid them (joining clubs/sports teams, going to events, meeting new people, talking to people at bars, etc.) altogether.  and#x200B; My social anxiety stems from insecurity and a lack of self-confidence. I wasn't beat up or anything as a kid, but I grew up being bullied, condescended toward, and made fun of for my lack of height at the time -- I was one of the shortest kids in school (I'm 5'8 now and have not been insecure about this in years) -- and for being skinny and small in general as a man in a society that often sees men like that as weak and a joke. Teachers told me I couldn't audition for roles because of my height, kids my age made fun of me, and adults made snide comments. All of this contributed toward deeply ingraining into my head a fundamental insecurity. I wore sweatshirts during the summer and shirts at the beach because I had terrible body image issues. From the age of like 10. **Long story short, from an early age I was very insecure, had major body image issues, and terrible self-confidence and this contributed greatly to creating my social anxiety.**  and#x200B; **Fast forward to today.** I am still skinny and small and find that the women who are into me tend to be 2-3 years younger usually because I \*do\* look young and small for my age. Dating can be frustrating. But, I am going to the gym, I'm starting to feel more confident in my body, and I know that I have had a good amount of romantic opportunities, even if it has never worked out into a relationship. I feel good about myself, have become extremely self-aware of my own insecurities and how I projected them in the past, and in general I am content. But, I still cannot get over the avoidance of social anxiety. It's ingrained into my head.  and#x200B; **It has prevented me from making more friends** in a new city -- the idea of doing a Meetup or joining a club is terrifying to me. And I just avoid doing that kind of thing altogether. **It has prevented me from, say, talking to women at a bar,** \*even in\* a drunken state when I feel good about myself. It just takes over and I tell myself I'm not attractive, that I'm going to embarrass myself, etc. It has essentially reduced my chances of meeting women to only on dating apps. **And it also has held me back in my career and what I want to do in life**. I'm a deeply political person but I can't network. I can't bring myself to go to happy hour's by myself or join political clubs or anything. I simply cannot put myself out there alone into unfamiliar situations. The thought of being awkward or having no one to talk to or being seen as ridiculous or an idiot -- these things fill my head and so avoid these situations altogether.  and#x200B; I don't want to look back five years from now and not have made more friends, not have taken a risk romantically by talking to someone I didn't know, and not have truly tried to pursue my political dreams. I have gone to therapy lately but the appointments are few and far in-between (once a month at best) and while it has helped me become even more self-aware, it has not helped me with, well, changing my brain chemistry. And I don't want to be resigned to thinking this is just how I am going to be. I am missing out on so many opportunities from friends to partners to career/hobbies. **Above all, I am frustrated that I have all the logical solutions to this problem (Who actually cares what people think of you?), but that does nothing for what feels like an innate reaction to unfamiliar situations**. **I can be confident one moment and then crumble the next. I get rejected in some form and it just feeds into a spiral.** **This is very long and I am rambling, but thought I would find friendly ears here. Maybe people in my shoes who have suggestions and have conquered (or struggle with) the same things I have. Feels nice to not be alone.**",2
c8s5l8,"running, run","I find a problem with every community I could become a part of. I'm 21 and this is something I struggle with a lot. It feels like most communities I have tried to be a part of have features around them that made me distance myself from being a part of that community. I understand that I am the problem in this situation and I'm probably overgeneralizing everything. Here are some examples: I enjoy casual gaming, but not enough to care about gaming news or events. I feel like a huge amount of people in the gaming community my age are overly edgy, rage a lot over games or are neckbeardy which scares me off. I also hate playing video games for hours on end, I get burnt out really easily and gamers usually like to have long sessions with each other. I drifted away from my gaming friends because the burnout from playing video games for hours at a time was too much for me. I enjoy hip hop and r andb, but a lot of the culture around this for my age is associated with people who smoke weed, drink, and go clubbing, which intimidates me as I don't like the loss of control associated with drugs and loud 'carefree' environments like clubs. I also feel like there's huge pressure to be on social media within this community. In high school I was friends with people who were into this community a lot and as they got older we drifted apart as they became clubbers and big on alcohol etc. I enjoy football, but I hate the competitiveness that comes with playing it (even socially, you'll get shouted at or made fun of for mistakes) and there is a hyper masculine/ drinking community stereotype associated with casual footballers my age. I also am terrible at football! I have always dabbled in and out of this community but as I was never very good, I didn't really get any respect, and I found playing a very high pressure scenario. All the above seem like immaturity problems, but there are other communities Ive tried to get into that I didn't have this problem with but I just didn't enjoy being a part of them. For example I have tried an art community, but I am not very good at art which made me embarassed whenever I went to the classes, and the way I think I naturally struggled to make and critique art. I also just felt very uncomfortable in this environment, which I think may be due to the fact that I'm not very passionate about art. I'm happy I at least tried though. I have tried a board game community, but I found it too nerdy for me, and I just didn't find any of the board games we played fun. I just didn't feel engaged enough and as passionate as the others were about the games, and the people in the group were all a lot older than me. I'm constantly looking for communities I can join which I will feel comfortable with. I am thinking maybe a running community. However I am worried that this problem is going to follow me everywhere since I seem to perfectionistic about who I be friends with. Like I already know I don't care about run times and stuff so I may feel out of place being surrounded by people who do care. If anyone else has dealt with this, it would be great to hear some advice. Thanks!",2
c99pmh,outside,How do I tell my mom about my social anxiety?. So I’m about to be 16 and don’t want social anxiety to ruin my social life at school this year too. It’s honestly been terrible and I want to get help from a therapist but I don’t know how to tell my mom. I have lots of friends at school but I can’t socialize at school. The only reason I have friends is because of my ps4 where I can talk without anxiety. I don’t know what my mom would think about me going to a therapist or even a doctor. She knows that I barely go outside and tries to get me to go to out but only with muslims cause she believes that other kids are bad for me. I’m anxious to tell her of my anxiety because she’ll say to “just go outside”. I was thinking that I should wait until I have a doctor’s appointment to mention my anxiety.,2
c9w3gb,"pool, swim"," So coffee didn’t happen.. I’ll link to the original post, but long story short I asked a guy to coffee. Everything was going fine, but then he sort of dropped off of texting and snapping conversations, wasn’t really interested in the conversation, wouldn’t initiate etc. You know, all the regular *bad* signs. I left it a few days and then snapped him a pic of me at the pool (swimsuit pic lol) and was like “what are you up to?” And he opened it and never replied. So then I got embarrassed, and also a little panicky feeling like coffee would be super awkward and weird. He told me that he would text me the night before for a time etc., but that he might forget because he was super forgetful (implying I should reach out if he didn’t). And I came up with this plan, that if he reached out I would talk to him/go/plan etc, but I was not going to reach out myself. I just planned to let it die. And then he didn’t reach out. Surprise surprise. The time we were supposed to have coffee has come and passed, now I feel awful and down. I realize he’s not the only guy out there or anything obviously but it still sucks. I’ve just never really had luck with guys, like ever in my whole life, and so sometimes I get this harebrained idea to try to make things happen myself, and it always backfires. [OG LINK](",2

I’m not a person who thinks he has OCD because he’s a perfectionist. I do relate to every problem posted by people here. Infact I’ve been anxious to post this. I’m a introvert and as a result I think I’m a dick to the handful of friends when they ask me to hangout and I reject. To add onto this I’ve gotten very insecure about my body(im morbidly underweight) as a result I never go outside without my hoodie to hide my tiny ass arms. I’m literally starting to hate myself. There’s not a single fucking thing I’m good at. I hate sports, I suck academically and there’s literally nothing I do. I can’t communicate to anyone not even my parents.

I’m 24 and my SA is getting worse every year. It’s weird because in my work life, I’m getting so much better. I’m an equestrian, so I ride horses and manage for a pretty famous trainer. I recently just became a manager, which is not super common in my industry at my age, so I’ve had to step up and do things that a year ago would’ve made me cry or freak out; like telling someone what to do, talking to strangers on the phone or going into places by myself and introducing myself to a ton of new people and I’m actually doing really well and am comfortable doing it. As my work life gets better though my social life is getting so much worse. Every time my work self takes a step forward, my social self takes like 5 steps back. I can hold a non work related conversation with a stranger while I’m working but if I met that same person outside of the work day I’d have a panic attack and not be able to say a word. Does anyone have any advice on how to turn my work self into my all the time self? Or has anyone else experienced this?",2

My mind is empty... people talk for hours i cant even talk for a few secs. Idk how to start convos maybe its just online chat that sucks the blood out of me. I cant even do a small talk. Idk how to ask questions about peoples interests... they tell what they are interested in it and i just say ""cool"" or thats interesting.. my convos are so dumb and dull and boring.. i cant attract beautiful intelligent women either. Im the worst human being in this earth by definition. Movies or tv shows make me sad cause ppl in there are.super cool super smart and rich and im a loser.

Maybe i should focus less on making friends online. Im worried so much about this.. im worried about what to say next. What do couples talk about everyday and never run out of things to talk about?? My questions are boring as hell. I just get yes or no answers... my convos are always generic.. i send 100 girls messages and i still dont get replied..am i just desperate or what. No one wants to hangout with me. Im so bad at everything. I feel like i dont exist. Im nobody. Everyone ignores me. Its like i want to be popular real bad just like my friends..idk how to stop trying My family always calls me a loser.. a man with no plans or future or skills. Im so lame. Im so annoying too. No one likes me. Im a nonsense and my talks are nonsense too. No wonder any cute girl would never put any effort in me. Its because i dont deserve it. I have nothing to offer. I have no personality. Im dumb. I never fit in.. And people get to me sometimes so easily. Im not really tough or assertive or a bastard that pushes away those who are mean to him. In texting while trying so much to make girls like me or value me or at least just say hello to me i try a lot and i turn out to be weird or boring or my talks are absolute nonsense... i dont know how to talk.

Some role model? Like who? James bond? What are convos suppose to be like? In real life and online?? I try really hard to make people laugh. It happens when i see someone being funny.. so i try to say something funny too. It turns out bad... I have spent so much of my life trying to be noticed/valued/heard.. and trying to get people to give me attention.. there is so much anger inside my towards my self and everything around me..

cgqagb,outside,"[LONG/VENT] My first 2 therapy sessions made me feel worse. What should I do?. 25 year old male, living with my mom alone. I've never worked in my life. Never been in a relationship. Haven't had a friend IRL in 10 years, which is also the amount of time that I've avoided going outside entirely unless absolutely necessary (a handful of times.). Never really been diagnosed with anything, but I have really bad social anxiety for sure. Deep depression and personality issues, adhd, possibly autistic spectrum. Who knows. I've avoided going to therapy/doctors for my entire life due to my anxiety and negative thoughts. I would talk with people online and I would always say that I would never go to a therapist, and thought it would never help me. This was based on brief interactions that I've had with therapists online, and me looking up stuff about therapists on the internet. Recently, other physical health issues of mine got so bad that I had to go to the ER, which lead me to going to a general doctor, which lead me to finally try to find a therapist. Problem is, I'm poor. I only have free insurance from the government, and there's only a handful of therapists in my area that take it. I looked at their profiles. A lot of them honestly made me upset and uncomfortable, so I tried calling the ones that I thought I might get along with. Every. Single. One. said they weren't accepting new clients. Which lead me to my only other option, going to a ""health center"" or something like that, dunno what it's called, but it's the place where courts send people who have drug addictions and stuff. I didn't really have an option and they basically just automatically assigned me a therapist. I felt very uncomfortable with the idea of it. I don't get along with people very well in general. I have a very low tolerance, but I'm so horrified of expressing my negative and rude thoughts out of fear for rejection. I really wanted to be able to choose someone that I thought would fit me well, but I still forced myself to give it a try anyways. I had this picture in my mind of how it would play out. I would come in, sit down. He would ask me questions and try to figure me out, understand my issues. I would try to open up, but mostly fail because I'm so anxious and I'm really bad at expressing myself. He would give hid input, professional advice, or ""help"", that would just upset and trigger me because I feel like it's just generalized advice for ""normal"" people that's not addressing the root cause of my issues. I would reject the help, repeatedly, until the therapist got sick of my rejection that they got rid of me and sent me to someone else. The fear of being rejected like that is so great that... It just makes it so hard to express my real thoughts and what I think. Anyways, what actually happened when I went to therapy... I guess it was what I expected and also not what I expected... what I expected was to be asked more questions, like he would make attempts at trying to figure me out or understand me, and that didn't happen very much. I tried talking about some of my issues anyways, and he said a lot of things that really upset me deeply, but I didn't feel comfortable expressing out of fear of upsetting him/him rejecting me. There was a lot of ""Learn to love yourself""/accept yourself/accept negative beliefs/be mindful/cbt kind of comments and ideas that he said. I don't know. I don't really feel it addressed my issues very well. I really didn't want to go the second time, despite the first one making me feel worse. I hoped that after going to the first session, that I would have just a tiny bit of relief, and a tiny bit of hope that MAYBE I could improve and work towards getting better, but it left me feeling more hopeless. I didn't want to go the second time, but it was more of the same basically. It's really hard for me to recall most of the things he said as I have a really bad memory, but most of it upset me and I suppressed my triggered feelings of anger and upset, again out of fear of being rejected and referred away. He talked about quicksand in analogy to struggles, and about how the more you fight against it, the more you sink, and you just need to calm down and just accept the issues and just let them be there. My mind screamed at me, NO!!!!!! I need help with my issues. I can't just accept this. I can't accept how of a miserable spot I'm in right now. I'm so fucking hopeless. I want to improve, not just sit around accepting and sitting in my misery. He talked about how he believes that everyone is fundamentally ""good enough"" and ""Okay"", which at my core I deeply disagree with. I definitely don't feel good enough, and have so many areas that I need to improve upon, and need help with improving on. I feel like he did more talking than I did as well, and that he didn't really want to seem to ask much questions or try to figure me out... is that normal? I want my issues to be addressed and I don't feel like they are being addressed. And I don't know if it's just my anxiety, but the interactions with him were so awkward and unbearable, but that's just how I am in social situations in general, all social interactions feel awkward and unbearable to me so I don't know if that was him or me. I scheduled a third appointment coming up this Friday, in hope that maybe it will somehow turn around and change, and start slowly helping me instead of making me feel worse and more hopeless when I go. I don't really feel have any options. I'm so absolutely stuck in life right now. I'm so hopeless and I don't know what to do. I feel like I need help, but so far I don't feel like this is helping, and I don't fee like it could help, and I don't know what could possibly help me. All I know is that this isn't so far and I don't know what to do. I don't know how therapy is supposed to go in the first place, or what to look out for, or what to expect from it, but I should feel like I'm getting SOME kind of benefit out of it, right? Is it normal to feel this negative towards it at first? I know how unstable and negative I can be... maybe it's just me getting in my own head, but maybe therapy isn't right for me and maybe I should jump ship? I just don't know what to do. Please give me some advice.",2

cmvab1,"garden, grass"," Does anyone else really wanna move out of their parents house, but just can't?. I've been living in a small village in Wales my entire life now, and I've always hated it. I have alot of non-anxiety problems with it, like the constant loud noise and being woken up by my neighbor's gardener every week to mow a small patch of grass, and the garbage internet connection. But my anxiety problems with this place are alot worse, like not being able to have any privacy. Or feeling like you're so disconnected from the world because you can't even take a bus into town. I wanna just move out so bad...but I can't. I'm so afraid of the crushing loneliness. I'd love to have a roommate or something but it terrifies me living with a completely new person. My family are away for the week rn and it pretty rough being in a big house on my own. Its pretty much being like in solitary confinement, you can't leave.

cnyep9,walk,"Girl at work. I don't get crushes often but there's a new really attractive girl at work that I recently got a huge crush on :(. I think I may or may not have overheard that she might be dating someone and so I'm like 90% she is but not 100% certain.  andnbsp; She's so incredibly cute and I really wish I was able to talk to her and express myself a bit better around her. I'm extremely shy, and have such terrible social skills, and socially anxious but like a high functioning socially anxious these days, and all my hobbies are introverted and aren't too social. She's the complete opposite - outgoing, enjoys talking and meeting people, and honestly really fun, funny, and easygoing.  andnbsp; I'm never able to start conversations with her because I never know what to say and I'd love to even just befriend her if she isn't single. She's initiated random conversations with me several times, and I always respond positively, and sometimes it even seemed like she would go out of the way to talk to me. One time I was walking forward and she walked right past me and I was gonna say hi awkwardly like I normally do, but she walked right by, then she turned back and said ""hey how are you doing kevin?"", and she seemed really interested. I always just default to saying ""good how are you"", and she ended up saying ""i'm doing really good"" and honestly just seemed super excited but the conversation kind of just ended since I didn't know what else to say and she was like awkwardly walking backwards back to her desk while tripping and regaining balance on her foot lol. We also went on an after-lunch walk together and we had a really fun chat (we both just happened to go out walking at the same time).  andnbsp; Every time I see her when we walk by like going to the cafeteria, at most I just awkwardly say hi and that's it. I feel like i might really appear uninterested to her when we talk since I don't say much, and maybe she doesn't like talking to me that much anymore because I may be boring or too quiet or awkward. I'm at the point where I'm literally thinking at the start of the day what I should say to her if I see her aside from ""hey how's it going, good, you? good"", and literally overthinking the shit out of the conversations and they always end up not happening. I'm also literally just trying to time my post-lunch walk right when she finishes lunch so it's like ""oh hey you're going for a walk now too? me too no way!!"" and I feel super creepy lol. I feel so lovesick (I think is the word)... and it especially sucks as someone with social anxiety where you really wanna talk to someone but are too anxious to, and honestly I'm just so lonely that I feel hopeless when I ""fail"" to just be the way I want to. And I also realize how hopeless this sounds since she most likely has a boyfriend, and I'm obviously overthinking everything, and most likely nothings going to come of it. I pay attention to how she acts to me and am hopelessly hoping and overthinking everything she does that might indicate that she possibly likes me too, when it's incredibly unlikely. I honestly feel like this same thing with very similar people has happened twice in college, and now again, and the feeling kind of just sucks.",2
co7hh2,"outside, walk","When will things ever get better? [rant]. I’ve never spoken out about my problems, and I’m not sure why I’ve come to reddit of all places but I’m just really hoping someone will listen to me and maybe understand... Basically my entire life has been revolved around making my mother happy, or her dictating what I can and can’t do. She always emailed my teachers when I was in elementary, middle, and even high school. She didn’t believe I could say what I needed to say or get the help if I didn’t understand something. She had an app that would show her my grades, and anytime I’d get a bad grade I knew that she was going to scold me. Now I fear that I will fail, and I do not know how to cope with failure at all. Whenever I’ve had boyfriends in the past she has always hovered over us 24/7. At 18 I decided to go to the movies with my best friend (he happens to be a guy but our relationship is strictly platonic). In the middle of the movie she turns on the find my iphone alert. Everyone in the theater turns to me because the alert sound is so loud. I have to run outside because I’m so embarrassed. I answer the phone and she’s yelling at me because apparently the map showed that I wasn’t where I told her I was (so she was spying on my location..). We argued and she made up some dumb excuse for why she embarrassed me.. saying the weather was bad and that she was concerned, but that it was my fault because I left when I knew the weather would be bad. I’m 19 now. She has access to all my emails (except one that I use for reddit) and social media. I now have social anxiety to the point where my mom has to do everything for me. Anytime our opinions don’t match or I give her “tough love” she tells me she feels betrayed by me. When I order food at restaurants I either let her order for me or I look to her for approval to go ahead and order. It is not even on purpose, it is just habit. When I’m at the doctors office I will explain my issues the best that I can, but she always has to add something because my explanation wasn’t good enough. When I get bad grades, I have a panic attack. I ask myself “what will mom do when she finds out?” I’ve never had a job because I’m too scared to work. My mom is obsessed with my weight. I am 130 pounds and 5 foot exactly. I’m a little on the thicker side but I’m not fat. There have been times when shes grabbed the fat on my arms, my least favorite body part, and said I don’t want my arms to look like “chicken legs” or something like that. I actually don’t normally hate my body, but every time she points something out I start noticing and hating it. Recently I went on antidepressants for my social anxiety. It’s only been about a week on them so I don’t expect much difference and there hasnt been yet. I know SSRI’s can take a while to work. I have eaten pretty normally, but my mom is obsessed with weight gain. I know they can make you gain weight, but its like thats all she talks about. These meds make you really tired so i havent been motivated, but she is forcing me to walk in the heat with her. Ive been telling her how tired they make me, but its like she doesnt understand. So I walked with her and afterwards felt so nauseous that i thought i was going to throw up (and i already have once). I don’t have anymore friends. I haven’t drove my car once this entire summer, and I hardly leave the house. Somedays I feel like a miserable excuse for a person, and this has made me think suicidal thoughts. The other day my mom actually told me that I don’t have depression because its not as bad as someone else she knows. No, maybe I don’t have “depression” but that doesn’t mean I don’t contemplate death. Before I started this medication I thought about death every single day and never told anyone. I love my mom, but this is the result of helicopter parenting. Now, I can’t even order food for myself or call the doctors office to set up an appointment. I would never want my child to go through what I now go through on a day to day basis. I feel like I’ve regressed back to infancy, always looking to my mom for approval. Raising my hand in class is an improvement for me. And that is just sad. At the same time my mom is nagging me to join clubs and make friends and I’m still trying to figure out how to raise my damn hand in class without having a panic attack. But no improvement is ever good enough. If I told her I raised my hand in class for the first time in 6 months she’d tell me that I need to force myself to join a club instead. Then I’m called too sensitive because I regress back into my shell after her statement. And apparently, we don’t believe in congratulating someone for little things like raising their hand because thats nothing. I am going to have to see my school counselor once the semester starts. I cannot keep living like this. This isn’t a reality to me. There is no way this is what my life has become. I have so much to say, and so many dreams of my own. I want to be successful. I don’t want to be figuring out how to be normal functioning human when I’m only months away from being 20.. I’m sorry if this whole thing sounds very melodramatic. I guess it is going to be dramatic for me... i’ve been dealing with it for at least 7 years now. 7 years of social anxiety that has gotten worse and worse over time. I might end up deleting this, idk. I just needed to write this somewhere. I feel so incredibly frustrated and yet completely numb at the same time. I don’t know what to do.",2

The moment I see people that have some sort of regular social comradere, i frankly lose my shit. I don't flip in public nor does it hit me immediately.

Our group originally had 4 people in in but one person left to sit with another group (I still talk to her at break and in some classes we have together). Anyways the girl that I thought was my best friend told me at lunch today that the friend that left for another group wants her to sit with them now but not with me and she said yes. Now I have no one to sit with or talk to at all and I'm going to have to walk home at lunch so I don't look like I have no friends (even though I actually don't). I wouldn't mind going home but it's a 20 minute walk there and we only get an 50 minutes for lunch which means that i'll have to walk home, stay there for 10 minutes then walk back.

Whenever I was sitting at a table or outside sitting on some steps, I wouldn't eat because I just didn't feel comfortable. Fortunately, I switched a particular class and got my lunch period switched. A few years back, during my freshman year it was even worse because I knew absolutely no one, and couldn't bear anyone seeing me alone, so I ate alone in the bathroom. I saw a whole bunch of freshman during the first few weeks eating alone, and even now almost halfway through the year I still see a handful of people eating alone. It makes sense to not want to eat alone though, because like you've maybe heard before, eating is supposed to signify that you're comfortable.",2

My 24th birthday was two weeks ago from tomorrow and I celebrated it without anyone close to me. It was at that moment that I realized I needed to step up and actively combat my anxiety for my life to have any chance of improving. Still, I have a few fears: * I only have one close friend irl at the moment and therefore, I joined two meetup groups in an attempt to establish better connections. Ostensibly, I’m a nerd and a gamer, but I fear that my potential new friends will judge me for not getting to play many games growing up and will think I’m practically an old man for my age. * I’m starting to date via apps such as OKCupid and did manage to secure one. I’m scared my dates will judge me for having relatively little sexual experience. (I’ve only had sex a few times) I’m also scared they will judge me for my living situation (more on that below). * I live with my parents still, since my line of work is hard to break into (Writing). I did secure an internship from home recently, which has the potential to move into full time work. I’m terrified that a potential partner will judge me for this. * I’ve come to the realization this last year that I’m fairly happy with only a close friend or two, yet I believe even an introvert should get out of the house semi-regularly. Can I balance both the loner and involved lifestyles? * I’m trying to lose a lot of weight and so far have succeeded. I cut out all junk food, soda, alcohol and fried foods and don’t eat meat three days a week. I exercise by jogging 5 miles a day. * I’ve re-entered therapy, since it’s extremely beneficial to my well-being. Am I too old to gain a decent social life, partner and job? I mentally feel like a teenager rather than a 24 year old man and fear that I can’t make up for lost time.

Changing your reaction from negative to positive, or at least to neutral is essential. Recently I've been able to laugh at myself a lot more, awkward interactions just amuse me now.

Every time I attempt to do anything I would like to enjoy, I end up feeling shitty for not having anyone I'm close with, so I therefore just feel like ""what's the point"".

I added her on Facebook after that school trip and she messaged me the next day, saying that she had seen me leaving school but I was already too far away. We chatted for a slight bit and then she said her class had ended she was leaving school. I just said ""ok, talk to you later"" or something along the lines. In reality she wanted me to tell her to meet up, considering that I was free, at home and so was she, free, leaving school. That was the end of our conversation, period. Over the next few weeks/months I kept seeing her at school seeing as we had similar schedules. We'd say hi and she'd always chat me up. At first we'd talk for 5-10 or more minutes. That faded to just saying hi, to not even acknowledging (or rather avoiding) her most times, even though the only thing I thought about while at school was seeing her. That went on for an entire year. The next school year started and for some reason I told my about all this and he, obviously, said how much of a dumbass I for not making a move. So I decided I had to confront her, which just so coincided with her birthday. I messaged her at night on Facebook, saying happy birthday. She responded early in the morning, said thank you and that she was heading up to the university. I, as well, had a class so I said I'd see her there. I saw her there and we talked for what seemed like an hour. At the end of it, I just confronted her about what had happened, asked her if she was expecting me to make a move (which I obviously knew the answer to, and it was yes), she said yes. Asked her if she'd be down to try to get things going now and she agreed. She had another class and I didn't so I left for home and messaged her as soon as I got there. We talked for the entire day, until she went to her birthday party where she wouldn't have access to a phone or internet. We kept talking non-stop every day, and not in a friend kind of way. It was obvious we were getting together. We met up. Texted. Talked. Met up again. Dated for like 3 weeks or a month and while I was very nervous at times, it was the best weeks of my life. I still remember her touch. Her kissing my cheek, my neck. After that she suddenly texts me saying she feels the relationship is heading towards a friendship rather than a girlfriend/boyfriend type of a situation, and that was due to me not showing enough affection, love. An *entire year* of being obsessed with her, finally mustering up the courage to confront her, us getting together only for it to fall apart so quickly absolutely *devastated* me. I was dead. Dead. We agreed on being friends, and we kept in touch. Talked on Facebook and met up from time to time. While I obviously still had feelings for her, and she was aware of it, it wasn't too bad. Yes I was sulking at times, but I was getting by. There were times where I didn't really even think of her that much. - And then this Friday...We decided to meet up because she messaged me saying she missed me a ton (I had seen her over coffee two weeks prior). We met up near our school, walked around for about an hour, then went to a bar where a friend of mine works and drank, but not a lot. Just got tipsy. We probably spent 3-4 hours there, talking non-stop. Then I took her home (which is pretty far away from mine). We sat outside her house at 1am talking and talking. It felt exactly like the times when we were together. And that, I think, was the final nail the coffin. Experiencing a situation so similar to the ones when we were dating brought it *all* back. I've had my moments of depression, usually a day or two, but it's never been this bad. I am extremely depressed and see no reason to live at all (not even considering suicide or harming myself). I can't get back with her, but I can't get her out of my head either. *All* I think about is her. The very first thought, every single day I wake up is her name. I don't see cutting her off as an option either because of two reasons. One, I *do* want to just be friends with her if being a couple is not an option because I get along with her more than anyone else I've met in my life. And more importantly, two, not being in contact with her doesn't seem to make me lose affection for her. I had almost zero contact with for an entire year and I was still madly in love. I'm sorry for such a huge post and seemingly hijacking yours, OP, but I really had to vent, even if no one reads this and also, hopefully, you realize you're not alone. Please feel free to message me.",2

d3xvyub,outside," Hi, To be honest, for me it is comforting that there are people in this world like me. I really thought that I was the one who failed so much in life. I didn't go to college, I never had a girlfriend, I lost all my friends due to my anxiety, I work from home so I rarely go outside and don't meet people. It hurts so much seeing happy couples in public and thinking to myself that I problably will never be able to achieve that due to my inexperience and anxiety. But remember that you are not alone. There are probably milions of people like you in the world. I know this sucks so much and I'm so tired of loneliness, but you have to have high hopes and pray for the best. Don't be pesimistic all the time. I'm here with you! ",2

d50m4nj,"camp, outside","While I was always the shy and quiet kid, I think I would have grown out of that if it weren't for an experience I had when I was 16/17. I went to the gaeltacht (irish speaking summer camp, 3 weeks only speaking irish away from home), when I was 13-15, and it was an amazing experience. I made new friends from all over the country, fell in love with the language, laughed so much every day. We stayed in houses and in each house was 1-2 leaders which were super bubbly talkative people who had to bring us out of our shell, break the ice in the early days, make sure we didn't speak english, and they also ran daily activities. I knew I was shy but I wanted to be a leader and I thought if I didn't know anyone then I'd be able to be that talkative and bubbly. When I was 16, I went as a leader. Everyone was SO SO extroverted, and because we were being ""evaluated"" by our superiors, being watched to see how well we mixed and interacted with other people, I got stage fright and didn't talk to anyone. It was horrible, I felt so ashamed of myself for thinking I could do this and for being the only one who was shy. They must have been thinking ""what the hell is she doing here"". Long story short, none of the other leaders liked me. Like, they hated me. They'd talk to me and I'd be super quiet and they'd do the ""okaaaaay"" and their eyes would dart around and smile at someone when they talked to me. They also gave me grief one day because this boy asked me out, they were making fun of me, which hurt because the girl who was laughing at me was once my leader when I was a student, and I used to be the type of kid who would idolise and have faith in people. This experience broke that. We have one day where parents visit and most people go to a neighbouring town for lunch with them, I saw the other leaders and said ""Hi!!"" and they blanked me. To give context, this wasn't a ""job"", leaders tend to form a close knit group, and I was outside of this. We had a day out to the cinema and there was no room on the bus so I had to go in a teachers car. The teacher shouted into the bus ""who wants to come with me and aoiphes in the car?"", no one moved. Anyway, I don't know why exactly but my faith in others and more importantly myself broke, and is still broken. I actually blocked the experience out, I used to think about it at night and literally sweat and cry and push it out of my mind - it was humiliation, 3 straight weeks of it. I'm leaving specific bits out because they're hard to describe but a lot of my flashbacks were of peoples expressions of suppressed laughter anytime I spoke to them. Or another leader rolling her eyes at me for not being good enough. It was like, you know when you do something silly by accident in front of people, and you think about it for years but the amount you think of it decreases with time? Well it's like that, only happening continuously for 3 weeks. I honestly think I got PTSD from that experience. It took me years to allow myself to think about it, and it was painful. My description probably doesn't make it sound that bad, but it was just things happening over and over again that confirmed for me that I was a failure and everyone hates me. Learning negative things about yourself one after the other with no time to process. It's been better lately. Sometimes I think about it without cringing. Again, this probably sounds like a relatively normal experience but it was just overwhelmingly negative and honestly ruined my life.",2
d5al7as,biking,"So you really think that even with acute acne and so much scars on my skin (from the acne) isn't repulsive? I've been trying to get that off me for more than 10 years now (I'm 22 M) and its still there. I tried like 20 different creams with no visible change, some of them even made it a bit worse. I even consulted a dermathologist who prescribed me strong pills against that. However, one side effect from that, which I wasn't aware of but my parent were, was depressio, and eventually suicidal thoughts (which happenned when I was around 15-16). And its not like I'm ugly. I'd be considering myself handsome if it wasn't for all of this, but I just consider myself ""meh"". I mean, nowadays its mostly scars, but I still have a bunch of red markings everywhere on my cheaks, neck, shoulders, back, chest which look like I have a lot of acne, all that since the skin in the scars is so thin that you can see the red of my blood more easily. But most women around my age probably think I'm disgusting and unclean because of all that, and thats not the case. I take 3 showers a day, brush my teeth after every meal when I get the chance to, so I'm clean and smell good, and my teeth are white, my hair looks clean, I shave... As for my shape, I look fit even though I don't exercise (except this weekend and yesterday where I started biking again to get myself in a better shape). I'm not thin and I don't look chubby. I look healthy. Its just the freaking scars and acne which probably looks disgusting. I would imagine I would repulse girls just for that single fucking problem. And thats probably why I have never been in a relationship, gotten laid nor even gotten my first kiss. And its not that I have a bad personnality either. The few girls I know told me they love my personnality since I'm a funny and caring guy, but they most likely would never date me. And my crush is even part of those girls (I'm planning to try to do something about that crush later this summer, a.k.a ask on a date). But right now, my life kinda looks like I'll never be in a relationship. And that sucks. But I try to ignore that feeling, else if would just make my SA worse all the time. And I'm doing good and am happy right now, so... I'm in my prime for trying dating.",2

d65r3b5,"camp, outside"," The link with social anxiety is that I don't have any goals and can't progress my life because I have no confidence which is because of social anxiety. The reason I cannot try new things, get a job, get the ball rolling, is social anxiety. The main reason I don't have goals is because in the past anytime I tried to achieve something, people dragged me down, which eventually led to social anxiety. The main thing that has affected my confidence and which turned shyness to social anxiety was this  last time I tried to fulfill a goal like this I ended up being told I was the complete opposite of what the role needed and not to come back, I did not do a good job. It was a job where I was a leader at a camp. I dreamed about doing it for years and then I did it and the experience was isolating and I didn't live up to my own expectations or anyone elses, I don't know how to describe it but I felt like the worst person on earth. I had to realize I wasn't good enough, happy enough, likeable enough for it, while no one encouraged me or gave me advice. Since then I have never been right in social situations and I haven't really tried to do anything outside of my comfort zone. This is good advice, thank you :) ",2

Both my parents have been teachers for 30+ years, and both agree they've never met anyone with as bad of anxiety as I have (that one hurt to hear). I used to lurk around here a lot on a different account, but was always too afraid to post anything. People kept lying saying it gets better every couple years, it'll be better soon. I'm 25 the only things that changed is I have a morbid sense of humor about my situation now. But yeah I kind of have a plan to go out if things don't at least start looking up after this latest go with therapy. I want to live and be happy, I really do.

d6hkeig,outside," I was so convinced at some point. Even my classmates said I seemed like an aspie sometimes, but I got it checked at the psychiatry twice and each time we concluded it probably wasn't that. I had too much of a social awareness to be an asperger, I guess. But it's ironic, because social awareness is still an issue for me. Sometimes people will make really obvious suggestions because I didn't catch their subtler hints and it makes me feel stupid and I generally often feel like stuff is going on around me I'm not aware of, but at this point, I think it might as well be from me not going outside enough. It's not that I have neurological disadvantages, just that I haven't learned the ways of people by staying away from them too often. ",2

Sometimes I make plans with her to go hiking on the weekend. We’ll make plans for one then she won't text me the day of until five saying ”sorry I slept in” she's done it about three times to me. She just doesn't set the alarm because ”she knows she’ll wake up.” I always seem to be doing only what she wants to do. We went to a restaurant I loved, and she said we could never go back because they took the pasta she likes off the menu. She makes comments about the way I look and my personality. I told her I was harassed and bullied so severely in high school. She has made comments about how my hair looks fake and overprocessed. I go to school and sometimes work as a freelancer. She's made comments to me sometimes when we hang out like ”SOME OF US have work in the morning” She says I ask too many questions because usually when I see my friends, I want to know what's going on in their lives. She doesn't ask many about me. I've gotten upset about her questions comments, but a mutual friend who I used to date says ”she probably thinks you ask too many questions or talk too much because she never stops talking about herself.” she's made comments like ”you either say nothing or express too much Love you though.” I sometimes binge drink when I'm stressed. I don't drink everyday or most weekends. I've been trying to cut drinking out of my life because I don't want to become a problem drinker. I see a therapist two times a week and always talk to my family about it.She's made comments about my drinking like ”oh my God your out of control and thank God your not drinking this weekend.” she also tries to baby me in front of people and take away my drink even if I'm having one beer. She smokes weed every single day. When I ask her to do stuff, I love like going to the movies, she always says no and makes passive aggressive comments about how I should stop asking her about it. I've gone to six different concerts she likes even though I've never listened to those bands to be supportive. In the last couple of months, I've become silent and walked out when she's made passive aggressive comments because I don't want to go off and say mean things to a friend, so I storm off and go home. She recently made a group chat sharing an old of my friends and me. I'm blackout drunk in the photo, and it's very embarrassing. I texted her to not post shit like that. She said she didn't think anything of it before she posted because it was a nice picture. I just said whatever.

Now that is not normal. I get like this before any social events too. However it's easy to forget because over the years I've organized my life so that in my day to day life I don't encounter that high-anxiety inducing situations. I can go to uni fine, I can have a presentation in front of a small group (anxious, but not too much), I can talk to people at work, I can go outside on the street without feeling anxious (only sometimes I do). So I'm betting if they say you had SAD at the hospital, then you must have had it. If your current psychologist does not agree, ask why and correct her if she's wrong about something about you. Be ready to see why you don't have it any more...or explain why you think you have it, etc. And if it doesn't seem right to you, you can always make an appointment with some other psychologist.",2

I really wouldn't know who to invite as most people in my life aren't big on physical activity. I'm mostly nervous about articulating myself properly, I tend to be scattered when I'm out of my comfort zone. I've tried therapy once before, my therapist was so nice but she made me really anxious, she was super confident and smiley and I felt like I had to emulate that even when I didn't feel the part. I noticed myself omitting certain pieces of information in fear of being criticized. I eventually stopped going. For a while I went back and forth on giving it another shot with a different therapist because I'm almost certain I will benefit greatly if I find a good one.

It was a huge confidence boost since a lot of people noticed the progress. Even a teacher I had a class with freshman year was impressed with the progress I made. Ever since I graduated, I still worked out from time to time, but unfortunately I gradually stopped going to the gym. The only workout that I would do was running. As you may know, doing a lot of cardio gradually reduced muscle mass and that's exactly what happened to me. I just recently hit the gym for a week 4 weeks ago and was shocked in how weak I've become. Even lifting the ""Barbie"" weights seemed heavy for me.

I think that without him we would have been more shy! Anyway we eat and then we went on a park to play some funny games. We spent like 7 hours together. It was fun, and we laughed so much. I wasn't super talkative, I found it easy talking with one person, or maybe two, and not with the entire group. But I tried. At the sime time, near the end, I felt anxiety kicking in, I don't know why, I had thoughts like ""I feel the others are watching me, they think I'm weird"" and I felt uncomfortable and I talked less. I don't know why I felt more anxious during the end, but I think it's because I was drained, I spent 7 hours with them! It was a bit strange for me to go out and meet strangers lol and I really don't know where I find the courage, but I think it was a big step for me. Now I have some anxious thoughts like ""they hate you, what do you think, you can never be social"". But I didnt' avoid the situation, I tried to stay with them!

day8mv,outside,"Trying to find out the development of my social anxiety + depression. Hey guys, I've been anxious and depressed enough that I can't take it anymore, when I was the age of 0-14 I was a funny, very social, empathious fun kid. I always had friends, always was a part of everything and everyone recognized me for my laughing. Untill I hit my puberty ( not the reason why I'm anxious I think ) since that time I got even scared to open the door, I still don't have a job ( I'm 16 now ) and I'm currently in wait for my new school which I'm 2 months later then everyone else. Just because I canceled my other school since I was too anxious of finding a internship work place. I still only have old friends from the time when I was 'myself' and no new ones. I've always been very hyper since I was a kid and then my parents decided to diagnose me and turned out I had ADHD. It dind't bother me at that time. I do speak to my parents but not very much. Especially not about my feelings which I don't do with barely anyone. I dissapoint them alot with my anxious feelings for example the one from when I needed to find the internship work place. My mom keeps saying that I'm anxious because I have been judged by everyone my whole life and I know she is right but its not only that, I have also been taking Ritalin for a few years and from that moment everything changed, one day when I felt very anxious after 30 minutes of taking my Ritalin. I was in school at lunch break just with a bunch of friends because I wasn't having those anxious issues then, but I felt very depressed and anxious then and I also later called my mom asked if I could go home because I was feeling sick. I dind't mention that I was anxious to her. Next day I woke up and again took my dose of Ritalin ( I'm not gonna call it medication ) I felt exactly the same as the day before so I called my mom again and asked if I could go home. I still dind't tell about the anxious and negative thought I had. From that moment I wasn't feeling myself untill this day. I am feeling so tired, nothing makes me happy and I just feel so fucking miserable and anxious about even doing the smallest things. The worst thing is that I KNOW I can be myself because I have been in the past, but I don't know how or what to do. I'm also using little doses of sativa or hybrid strains of weed ( I vaporize them ) and it does really help for my ADHD to calm down my brains but it still doesn't make me feel myself happy from how I used to be. Obviously I still have some days where I feel happy but those only happen like once in a month . I also once was out for dinner with the whole fam and I was feeling very drowsy and just not active but I brought my filled vaporizer ( dry herb vaporizer ) with weed. So I vaped outside and I was myself again, I was talking to my fam and it was like I was reborn again. When I got home I was so happy and mostly proud, I later said to my mom what I did when I went outside and she already knew I smoke and shes okay with it as long as I don't get addicted and she also was a bit happy because she really saw the diffrence, its not always when weed works like that. But when I'm with friends and I smoke I always feel very comfortable around them and have a good time. They mostly make me forget to look at my phone so thats a good sign. I really want to feel like how I used to because most people liked me then alot. I also stopped growing from when I was using the Ritalin and last year I have grown so much from the moment when I stopped using it. I feel like ritalin fucked up my serotonin receptors because I know alot about all drugs. I know that Ritalin is in the same family as speed which makes it possible that it fucked up my serotonin receptors. Anyhow I've also tried LSD a couple of times and it made me social anxious as fuck, really dind't wanna see anyone when I did that. But I know that that isn't how I am because I used to be so social but how come I'm not anymore? If anyone has tips or questions. Please feel free to ask / tell them!! I use L-theanine now for a while and it makes me alot more relaxed in my head, but they don't bring back the old me. I don't use chemical pills ever again because they're dangerous and addictive. Not only because they're toxic itself but also because they might have fucked up my whole personality. Its insane that when I think of it now they just give speed to 8 year olds because they have a disorder which makes them hyper in their head. Its not right, thats the reason why I only use natural products to relax my brain, L-Theanine, weed and omega-3. I also have used XTC like 3 times and when I do xtc I can talk to people again with no problem and it just goes extremely easy then. But I don't use it more then twice a year. Please if anyone has any tips or comments pleasee ask or tell them! Also if someone knows how to like boosts my serotonin/dopamine receptors I'd love to hear how. I really wanna get back to the person I used to be. And I'm not the only one. Thankyou for reading &lt;3",2
db6e3ig,outside,"I know exactly what you're talking about dude. I had this problem all throughout high school. Now it's even worse though because it happens at work, and I work on movie sets, and on movie sets they usually record sound because it's post-1920, which means everyone on set needs to be DEAD silent. Sometimes there are emotional scenes with long, silent pauses in between actors' lines. Sometimes there's just quiet while they're waiting for an airplane to go by. And at the end of every day or when they finish shooting in a particular space, they record ""room tone"" which is just 30 seconds of complete, 100% silence. And usually these spaces are very small and filled with lots of people like the director, the script supervisor, the 1st AD, the DP, the 1st AC, the 2nd AC, the boom operator and/or sound mixer, 1+ talent, possibly other department heads like the gaffer, key grip, production designer, or makeup, possibly multiple PAs there to make sure everybody is quiet, etc. and if you make noise you've fucked up the take. I have such severe anxiety about stomach noises on set that I basically try to avoid actually being on set as much as possible. I'm constantly terrified of getting stuck inside when they're about to shoot, because as an electrician I might need to be nearby for small, last second lighting adjustments, or even worse, to do a light gag (lights go on/off or flicker/dim during the shot). I avoid it at all costs and try to stay in an area with no people or somewhere outside where it's loud. It's a daily source of anxiety for me because I never know when I might end up in one of these situations. I've noticed it seems to happen more when I'm anxious, which is almost all the time, and additionally, when I'm anxious ABOUT it happening--like it causes itself in a vicious feedback loop. I think for me the physical symptoms of anxiety must somehow cause it, because it's become very evident that I get stomach problems the more worried I am, for example I'll be fine in the morning when I first wake up, but as I'm driving to work, I start to feel sick and I do for the first few hours of the day until I calm down. Basically, I'm pretty sure the answer is just relax, just chill out mentally, and your body will respond by being at ease. Obviously this is way easier said than done for people with SA. Other than that just drink plenty of water, eat a healthy and balanced breakfast (but not too much), get enough sleep, exercise (this is a huge one), and overall just take that extra step to take care of yourself and your wellbeing. PM me if you want to talk more because I guarantee you I've thought about this topic and worried over it way more than most people.",2

You can totally ignore her, but you can rediscover a friendship you two used to have. The worst thing that can happen is you ending up not meeting her again in your life, which is pretty much the same thing as choosing not to meet her at all. You can be honest with what you're going through, if she is not an asshole who will judge you. If you honestly 100% feel that she will laugh at you then don't go. But if she is a person you used to be close to, give it a try. I wish my old friends were still with me. edit: I wanted to add that if you have a real big trouble being in public or in a shop or whatever, you can just ask to go on a walk instead of having to speak to other people. People change, for better or for worse, we don't just grow we sometimes get stuck in life and every mature person can understand it.

I just stall myself by being like, ""it's just in your head don't make a big deal about nothing,"" I know how stupid this sounds but I also feel like I'm too young to be depressed. Whenever anyone asks what's wrong the answer is im fine, because I don't know how to explain and really not comfortable trying to. But it's not just this, I've never been good at trying to tell people how I feel and then break down later. Also my parents don't understand why I say I'm fine and get angry with me. They thought I got over my ""shyness,"" years ago although I'm pretty sure I'm just introverted and socially anxious. Recently it's got worse though and I really don't want to go outside but have to because of school but it's making me really nervous so half the time I leave at lunch because I just can't stand it. I get into trouble for it obviously but anywhere is better than there. I do thankfully have friends and classes can be bearable or with any luck enjoyable if I sit near them, but the teachers don't let friends sit with each other yet force us to sit in groups. I don't know if this is related to my potential anxiety but I sweat a lot at school even the palms of my hands which just adds to my discomfort, it's not even that warm there. Doesn't help that all the teachers hate me. They know I don't know the answer, they know I don't care, they know I wasn't listening, they know I hate speaking out, yet they always ask me. When they ask me to read something out, I will say three paragraphs in like 5 seconds without breathing just to get it over with but I can just tell that no one understood a thing I said.

dck3vu,"soccer, walk","Anxiety with Girls. For background, I'm a 22 year-old male and I've had pretty severe social anxiety for my entire post-adolescent existence. I'm back in college now for the first time in a year and a half after taking time off to treat anxiety, depression, and substance use and absolutely nothing has changed. I'm feeling so hopeless. What gives me more anxiety than anything though is talking to girls. I just cant imagine initiating or taking a lead in any situation with a girl. The only real girlfriend I've had the night we first got together we were sitting alone and I knew she wanted me to kiss her it was painfully obvious but I couldnt even do it. She had to text me after I left saying ""you should've kissed me."" I had to leave her to go back to school and I honestly believe unless something changes I'll never be with anyone satisfying again. I've actually been with a decent number of girls but mostly just off tinder and often much less attractive than me. I have a super high sex drive though and a real burning desire for intimacy of all kinds but I feel completely powerless because I don't think I'll ever be able to approach a girl in any way. So anyway tonight I was watching a soccer game at my school and ended up sitting next to this absolutely beautiful girl. Like stunning. And I didn't even feel like she was out of my league, like I often do, she was just perfectly my type. The whole time I'm sitting there I'm thinking just say something to her anything anything but of course I couldn't do it. When I walked home I felt like killing myself. It makes me feel hopeless and emasculated and I don't know what to do. Just had to get that off my chest I don't have anyone I can even talk to about this",2
dcml3d,outside,"Social Anxiety from eating in public. Advice on self-help tips for overcoming this?. Sorry in advance for the long story that i’m about to post but I hope you guys give it a read. I’ve been getting social anxiety especially from eating in public for 2-3 years now and the fact that I can’t even have a peaceful/enjoyable meal out with my friends have been eating me inside out and I want to overcome this so so so badly. The past few years has honestly been the worst few years of my life and I so desperately want things to change. The eating anxiety I have doesn’t really come from being afraid of being looked at in public, its more of being afraid that I would gag/throw up when eating because of the intense nauseous feelings I get whenever I am eating outside in public and it simply just kills my appetite. Its like a vicious cycle. This is how it all started. 3 years ago, I was still all fine with very minimal social anxiety. Since young I have always been a shy and quiet person if you don’t get to know me well but among my friends i’d like to think that I am quite talkative and fun. I hung out with friends very easily in school and used to enjoy going out with them. I even had many friends from the “popular” group in school if that’s what you call them. However sadly this changed for the worse in 2017. I was finishing school and was about to enter mandatory military service. I suddenly got so much anxiety ever since I was about to enter military as there was so much uncertainties that I had about it. I was afraid that I would have a tough time, afraid that I would not be able to adapt to a very different environment, afraid of missing home too much etc. To put it shortly, there were so many things that were not under my control that gave me so much anxiety during this period. I was still at school when all these anxiety came about, and it seemed to just keep getting worse during that time. Sometimes in the morning before going to school i’d feel nauseous for no reason, even brushing my teeth in the morning would cause me to gag. Sometimes (even though rarely) I would even have to go to the toilet just because I felt like throwing up from the nausea I was getting. I started losing appetite very easily and started to rarely have a proper meal during lunch time in school. I started avoiding going out with my friends because of all this feelings I was getting stemming from the anxiety I got. Fast forward to now, I have completed my service and about to start uni early next year. I would say that my anxiety has gotten much better compared to where I was a few years back. However I was never the same in terms of eating in public ever since. I still get all nauseous/choked up/no appetite whenever I am eating outside. When I eat at home its the complete opposite, I can properly enjoy a good meal with no issues at all when i’m home, because I feel “safe”, that even if I throw up/gag nobody can notice or judge. And because of this sense of safety, ironically I don’t have any anxiety at all and don’t feel any nausea, However when i’m out I can only eat in small bites and I find it so difficult to even finish a normal meal. Its taken such a massive toll on my social life. In the past I would hang out with my friends every week, and also go outside to play sports every week. Now these things rarely ever happen anymore, not because I wasn’t invited but because I had to reject my friends every time they asked me out because I didn’t want to end up embarassing myself when we have a meal. Honestly this really hurt me so much because my friends probably now thinks I am deliberately avoiding them or that I don’t wanna hang out with them anymore but the truth is I really don’t have a choice because of all the anxiety I have had experienced. Sometimes I just wished that everyone can understand how I feel or what I am going through. I am starting school again in a few months and I really want to just change myself, and go back to my old self where I had no anxiety when eating in public, where I could really feel joy and happiness when going out with my family and friends, where I don’t have to keep worrying about my eating anxiety, and where I can just feel genuinely happy again. Please advice me on tips I can use as self-help to overcome my social eating anxiety, and thank you for taking the time off your day to read my story. ☺️",2
dcvk0cj,outside,"Yeah my first date with a girl when I was 18 (20 currently) wasnt the best I had tons of social anxiety back then. 80% of success is just showing up. Dont listen to your mind, youre going to be nervous as fuck and its okay to be nervous do not resist it or get angry that you are or youll just make things worse. I hung out with a girl today and I was nervous haha after about 20 min of talking it went away and felt really comfortable with her, I actually started dancing not very srsly but still haha (we're outside and I mentioned I want to get good at dancing and she said show me so I danced like a moron haha) and just started saying everything that came to my mind granted Ive hung out with her once in the past, but still a really attractive girl that makes me a bit nervous. Anyways, being nervous isnt that big of deal, everyone is to a certain degree, take deep breathes before, I dont recommend drinking, if you have a benzo on you maybe take one? Be careful with those and dont mix them with alcohol. Also, give him a hug when you meet him ""Hey hows it going nice to finally meet you"". Best of luck! I understand how you feel try your best its just a random guy on tinder remember that. No pressure logically. Have a fun time and hopefully you and him become friends. If your date has empathy, is a nice guy, mention youre nervous and be confident saying it. When I'm nervous with a girl sometimes I mention it and it always goes well as long as I'm confident about it. I've even said to a girl once ""I'm a little nervous to be honest, attractive girls make me nervous"" I calibrated it really well, It came off well haha. Crush it I was in your shoes once and millions more too :)",2

So as one of my nephew's were speaking to her I was kinda trying to walk pass so she wouldn't notice me lol, but then she said oh hey ""jasmine"" and I was thinking like dang it but I said oh hey how are you? and she said "" I'm doing good"" ""how are you"" and I said that's good I'm doing good then she said alright see yall later bye. Okay I know something like this shouldn't be a big deal or something to overthink about, but me being me that's just how I am and yeah it sucks because now I'm thinking that she probably was thinking dang this girl is weird like I literally couldn't even get the words out of my mouth trying to speak by the way I do smile a lot when I'm speaking to people because it kinda helps me from freaking out you know.

ddbvvtu,outside," Anytime, darlin'! I'm similar to you in that I don't watch sports, don't really go on dates (rarely asked!), and I don't drink very often. And you are right..being asked why is awkward and kind of annoying! Perhaps we relate though in our reasons. I feel like it's both for me. I often don't know what to do outside and sometimes even if I do know what to do, I have anxiety! Most of it now is that I don't have anyone to do those things with. Venturing out isn't fun for someone like me if I'm alone. My anxiety tends to increase as I probably have a slightly dependent personality. I actually am willing to go out now and even join in with a group of people for a sports game or whatever it might be..but I can't seem to find the group to do it with.......without going by myself first..which I don't want to do.....it's kind of a never ending cycling. I'd have to figure out the point that I can break it and then actually proceed to do so. What about for you? Would you say it's both? ",2

I do know someone else though who was even more shy than me but he played soccer just fine.

You just got to be friendly and just pick the people you relate with the most. I wasn't the most popular person by any means I'd say I was the average school goer and made like 4 friends i still see and 1 really close friend I hang out with every weekend. Depending how old you're old enough just invite some guys to the club or if you're younger invite them over to play videogames or biking or something.

deqfrk,"outside, climb","My struggles with social anxiety. I had pretty severe social anxiety coupled with depression in high school and a fair bit of college. I experienced most/all of the things you mention. I wouldn’t go anywhere for weeks for fear of people seeing me. I was terrified if I went outside to get the mail that a neighbor would see me and judge me. I’d only go grocery shopping at bizarre hours and only use the self check out because of fear of what the cashier would think of me and my purchases. Going to any social event caused panic attacks (sweating, trembling, trouble breathing, chest pain, dizziness). I lived a solitary life and would go months without social interaction. Going so long without having so much as a conversation made me really awkward in any social interaction that I did have. I would be really quiet and keep to myself. Afterwards I’d over-analyze everything that happened, even for days or weeks. So how did I climb out…? Very slowly. I have been on and off antidepressants (SSRIs) since I was 15, never on for longer than 3 months, then I would hop back on when I started to feel really down. I think they helped with the depression, but not so much the social anxiety. I have been on and off therapy as well…and couldn’t really commit to that either. It’s hard to go tell someone your most intimate feelings and thoughts when you’re afraid of how they’re judging you. However, I think it does help some people. I was recommended this [book](It might help. I made one friend towards the end of high school. I had no idea why he wanted to be my friend, but I was so desperate for a friend I just went with it. I found it much easier to just hang with 1 person than a large group that I didn’t know. Then I made one really good friend in my first year of college. She much more actively took action to become my friend, than me becoming hers. We became basically inseparable, and she was my only friend for a while but that was okay because all my social needs were met through her. I transferred schools and she got a boyfriend and our very codependent relationship kinda fell apart. I felt lost for a while, but that is when I realized that I shouldn’t be that dependent on someone else. I made a friend at my new school. I moved on campus and started interacting more with my roommates. I became involved with clubs. I started by just attending talks and meetings, then eventually went onto becoming an officer. A lot of classes were team projects, so I befriended some teammates. I took a teaching assistant position and met people that way. As my circle of friends grew, I met more friends through them. I threw some parties. I went to parties. I learned that sometimes you have to be assertive when making friends. I faked confidence and asked people to hang out, chatted them up online, said hi and talked to them when I saw them. Eventually, it starts to feel less forced and more natural. By the time I graduated I had a great group of friends ranging from very close to not so close. It wasn’t smooth sailing always. I had a really hard time during my internship. I didn’t fit in with the other interns at all. It was like they just looked at me and labeled me as a loser. I felt very socially awkward since most of my friends were also very nerdy/geeky and the interns were a different breed. I did try, but I failed and it was a hard summer for me. I spent most my weekends alone while the others were out doing what interns should do when spending the summer in a beautiful new city. About 6 months ago I moved to a new city, and it’s been tough making friends and adjusting. I feel the insecurities and low self-esteem creeping in on me. I hated constantly meeting new people and small talk. I’m so paranoid that people will see through my confident veneer and find me to be just a giant loser. I miss the easiness with my friends. I tried organizing events with some people at work, but those fell through. Sucks being in a new city with so much to do, but no one to do with it. In the back of my mind, I still fear that if I go do things alone people will see me think of me as a friendless loser. As you can see it’s still a struggle sometimes, but I know I’ve come a long way. I don’t think I’ll ever be the life of the party or 100% not socially awkward. I still have fears and insecurities, but I think the best way to get over them is to just face them. Sometimes you’ll fail real hard, but you’ll learn and get better. I know it’ll be a while before I build a social network like the one I had in college. I’m gonna try taking a fun class after work, meetup.com, and finding a place to volunteer. I’m planning on facing my fear of doing things alone…and I’m gonna go out there and do things alone and hopefully make friends along the way. [part II (Julie)](",2

These games are full of creeps who don't care how their actions and what they might say might affect other people. And even if the SA wasn't talking for you, these are not the type of people you would to impress or be friends with. And rationally if you can't respect the person, you can't respect their judgment. Like the other day I was walking down the street and some asshole said something mean. And I calmly explained to him how some drunk outside a bar at 2 in the afternoon, who not only has no control of himself but who also can't help but leak his insecurities on to random passers-by, could never ever gain my respect and therefore I could never care about what he has to say. His jaw dropped, he stared at me stupidly and I walked away. Okay enough of a rant Lol. If you want to think rationally and be free from social fear then you have to kick SA in it's lying butt.

dflfrpc,parkour," Don't say never. You don't have a girlfriend now. So what? Does that mean you'll never get one? No. Your present does not determine your future, as you have the power to make the decisions to change your future into a more desirable one. I understand this can sound harsh, but OP, I needed it when I felt the same way as you, so hear me out. By the way, the size of your dick doesn't matter as some girls can't comfortably take a lot anyway. Sex is not a requisite for social status. Don't let society fool you. A relationship will not be healthy in the long term if you are emotionally vulnerable. Take the time to grow and take care of yourself first, worry for yourself before other things. Please stop smoking and drinking alcohol. Find an alternative, even vaping or whatever. When you try a certain way and it doesn't work, try another way. Alcohol is a depressant. Smoking shits on your health. Don't consume them. Take up classes. Dance, martial arts, parkour, cooking, anything. Help the community out, volunteer. The Meetup app has clubs you can join to meet people of similar interests. The best way to rid yourself of social anxiety is through exposure. You can learn social skills. You have so much potential, OP. You just have to keep your head up despite the challenges (it will not be easy), and don't let yourself stop you from progressing. Our biggest demons are not the adversities around us, but ourselves. Keep a realistic mindset and you can get to what you want. Be wary of absolute thinking patterns. You can do it. Whenever you get depressive, be your own cheerleader and remind yourself of what you can achieve. You are never weak due to mental illness. Having mental illness is hardcore, and you are so strong for wrangling it. If you need further support, hit me up. I'll be happy to help you in any way I can.

I think she had a boyfriend in senior year though so she was out of the question. It was also expensive  and i think you had to buy 2 tickets. Then about a month later, my parents asked about prom saying when is it  and i said i missed it because we went to the beach that day  and they got pretty mad saying how i should have told them sooner, they only planned that week to go to the beach, and started saying how im missing out  and that I will regret it. Deep down I do regret it, but at the same time i dont because i hate dancing. I think they are just mad cause they dropped out of HS  and had kids at a young age so they didnt get to do these things. My sister did go to hers which was 2 yrs later but of course she is very outgoing  and people cant tell if we are related sometimes. I'm not ugly or anything, just really bad social anxiety  and nerdy that sometimes people thought she was older than me. If you dont believe me, check out my nerdy youtube channel I'll pm a link.",2
dgsge3h,"walk, outside, running"," In my school we always talked about how there was obvious bullying and ""inside-bullying"". I've been a big victim of the inside-bullying too. Nobody respected me and they obviously talked behind my back because they thought I was annoying or weird or unlikeable and like you've experienced, they also made these strange proclamations of my name in class too and I think the straw that broke the camels back was when I started to realize that when we had to do the ""find someone to be in group with"" stuff people would walk away as soon as I walked over to them even if I had occasionally talked with them before. It's a testament to how bad my social skills were and how asocial i was outside of classes but what could I do? I couldn't figure it out and people started to think me annoying for it which led to internal bullying. In middle school I had more of it. People would always put me down for whatever I did that wasn't academically succesful which was at least nice so I had something I was okay at, at the time. If I started running people would point and laugh because ""you're a nerd and you can't be sporty"". If I said something I thought was funny then people would default to arrogance and assume what I was about to say would be stupid and then look at each other laughing at what I said as if they were embarrassed I was trying to make eye contact with them because I wasn't worth talking to. I would go as far as to say I have a kind of built up hatred towards people in general over my early schooldays. I know my problems stem from my own lack of putting myself into respect, but sometimes one thing leads to another for no particualr reason and you're put in an unfortunate position for the rest of your time in a group and that can scar you for life if you can't move on from it easily. I don't think often about it admittedly, but if I have to think back in my life all my problems started early on like that. I don't trust people and I assume what I do will be unworthy or stupid or cringeworthy before I even try and i don't take risks because I'm afraid people will laugh or ridicule me. It's not irrational. That whole ""anxiety is irrational"" crap is bullshit if you have tried being bullied. It's real and there is a consequence that genuinely hurts if you fail and you've tried it before, and my worst thoughts tell me that I hate a lot of people for not understanding because they're had it incredibly easy. They've never fallen out in a group and they've never done something bad which they couldn't then defend or make up for afterwards. They've not been stuck in a hole without the skills to crawl up again. They can make it seem like anxiety is strange as much as they like and I'll hate them for it just for their lack of understanding. Anyone who's been a victim of anything will have a newfound dislike for a group untouched by those kinds of circumstances. They don't know anything nor could they care about it unless they try it. That's probably the darkest corners of my mind; the thoughts that say to me that I really want ""good"" people to have it bad. I want people to be bullied like I was. It's like a revenge fantasy that I can't put a lid on. I won't like people who have it good. I just can't help but hate them. ",2

dgvqkda,run,"That sounds really cool I started thinking about creating games during my phase of playing Dota and mastering it during the entirety of my puberty. I wondered how developers created the metas and the maps and items ect and I was thankful for there work. What type of games are you studying/working on developing? Like on Pc, AppStore, or Console games. Also, what games do you play? For the gym I can tell you since I've been doing a lot of research about health, nutrition, and bodybuilding. It all depends on what your goal is like to be just Fit lose couple pounds, To Lose a Ton of weight, or to Gain Muscle. Remember those huge bodybuilders had to start somewhere. What body builders usually do or skinny people is bulk up- eat a ton more then they workout out gain more muscle and strength and then cut- do more cardio eat less to get the sixpack/defined muscles. But you can also do cardio to fill out before you start lifting. If I would have to give couple tips for working out it would be Consistency Diet Not worrying about results You can workout your hardest but if you still eat like shit you will not get results. Now since I told you you shouldn't eat like shit you might ask the question what should I eat? or maybe I can't afford organic or good foods or something along the line. I'm going to be a 100 diets will not work for you and when I mean ""Diet"" I mean just going on a diet for couple weeks and then stopping and going back to what you usually eat. You have to make a lifestyle change. That means quitting foods that are making you gain weight and replacing foods that make you not gain weight. I'll tell you straight up what worked for me. Ok here's what I do I would waking up early and then run a mile everyday with empty stomach w/ only water. Then for lunch everyday I ate a salad (Which I hate) and water. Lastly when I got home I ran another mile and for dinner I ate either Starches, Fruits, and Veggies. Sleep is also essential because that's where you lose weight/gain muscle. That would be my ""Diet"" plan to lose weight fast but if you ever want long term results your going to have change your lifestyle/eating habits and either eliminate, reduce, or replace them. I can also give a list of amazing foods and a book that I would 100% recommend for people trying to lose weight. That sounds amazing that you got on a date! It's fine do whatever seems right I would get her talking about her life get to know her more. You have to master the skills of Listening to keep the Convo going with follow up questions or relating stories and then ending the convo with like another date or something.

The '80s were a strange period in America during which anything even slightly unknown became a sense of paranoia. Every stranger was out to kidnap and/or rape and/or sell marijuana (which will lead to them instantly being addicted to heroine) to your child. Every film, book, or video game was a satanic trap that would warp your child's mind and make them obsessed with violence and sex. Pretty much every one of those things is a complete and utter lie. Children are much, much more likely to be abused or kidnapped by adults they know. The entire war on drugs is ridiculous and counter-intuitive. Games and movies haven't lead to an increase in violent behavior. In fact, America, and the rest of the world, has become immensely safer over the last century. Not only will you be safe outside in your neighborhood, but you will be safer than any time in history. You'll be ok.",2

I went to school in Chicago, so there was a bit more to see than your average suburb, but I'd just start walking in a random direction. At some point, I'd decide to go in another direction and at some point I'd decide that I'd want to go home. And then I would. Nobody looked at me weird because nobody cared what I was doing. I'd have my earbuds in and I'd take my time looking at the stores and building that I passed. Look around. There are people everywhere going somewhere different. That was a mess of nonsense, but here's my point: You have autonomy. You're allowed to do (legal) things that you want for no other reason than because you want to. Also, you can walk at night.

dlbwpr,"garden, walk","I froze twise while approching a on Ecstasy.. (Long Post) (Need help) This happened yesterday, their was a fest going on in our University and since it was my last fest, i decided to drop Ecstasy. Since our University is located in a rural area their are no proper bars or pubs to drink, so the students have started drinking in a garden which is 50 metres from our University. This was a three day fest and on day two i went out drinking in this garden. I was drinking with my buddies (all guys) and after some time a group of girls from our University came and started drinking besides us. While drinking i noticed that two girls from that group are checking me out. Something about myself:- I am a 21 year old law student in the last year of his course. I have major social anxiety and in my five years at Uni, i have only socialized with a small group of people in my four years in Uni and almost all of them were guys. This was primarily because i got a cultural shock when i moved from a small town to one of the elitist University in India. I am 6ft 2inch with good facial features but a skinny frame. Generally people rate me 7/10. I was decently confident when i started University, but due to my inability to speak fluent English (which is the primary language of conversation in this place) and the highly urban crowd which i had never experienced before, my self confidence was very badly damaged. On top of that i made friends with people who had the same problem of language and culture like me, people who didn't exactly 'fit' in this place. Irrespective, they were pretty toxic and always discouraged and scrutinized any attempts that I made to socialize with people out of our social circle. They would make fun of me for misspranousning words in my presentation and not able to form a coherent sentence when participating in class or speaking to other students. This led to me becoming more and more anxious leading to a total stop by me to try anything or interacting with new people. I just started keeping quiet in lectures and just didn't interact with anyone in the class and made my body language very unnapprochable. This led me getting isolated, loosing my self worth and growing more and more insecure about myself everyday. I started suppressing my opinions and started doing everything which was acceptable by my isolated group of friends. I turned to weed and used to numb myself with it to coupe with the anxiety but the paranoia kept making it worse. I finally started fighting back from my third year and started working on myself. I started getting better at speaking English, learned a lot of new things, got better at studies and putting my opinion forward. I started being more assertive about my boundaries and stopped my friends from walking all over me all the time. But still there is a lot of anxiety, insecurity and an overall inferiority complex. I have only dated one girl in my life which was long distance, we met twice in 3 months and just made out. I don't consider this a proper relationship though. I have a decent amount of good female friends. But it is very difficult for me to talk to a unknown girl, and usually make a fool of myself. I get a decent amount of female attention and a lot of girls have tried to flirt with me but i just get too anxious and awkward. I start overthinking the interaction and always find a way to convince myself that this one isn't right for maybe the next one. However, now i have changed myself and i am trying to actively communicate with girls. I even approached two girls in the gap of six months and got rejected both the times due to very awkward conversation both the times. I have been feeling very lonely for the past 3 years and i crave romantic intimacy. Coming back to story:- After realising that both of them have been glancing towards me, i started making eye contact with the one I was interested in. However, like always i didn't approach her and just left the place after finishing the booze and even give a look back. The next day( last day of the fest) i popped ecstasy and went to the garden with my friends, i started tripping intensely after i reached the party garden. Coincidentally, the same group of girls from day two came and started drinking 20 meters away from us. At this time i had reached my 'peak' of ecstasy and was tripping major nutsack. The high started reducing and got a collected my self a little bit but i was still pretty high, now i start noticing that the same girl from yesterday was again galncing at me in very short intervals, i started making eye contact with her but would break it in 2-3 seconds because of second thoughts. My friends started leaving for college but i was still pretty high so i decided to stay on my own, i started socialzing with people that i knew and all this while me and that girl kept making eye contact. I still wasn't sure weather i should go and talk to her. Then she looked at me for like 10 seconds without breaking eye contact and gave a huge smile. Because of the lowself esteem idiot that i am, i looked turned my neck in both the directions to confirm that she was actually smiling at me. Any other day I would have bounced from that place without approaching her because of my fear of rejection and making a fool out myself but not this time. This time i was on Ecstasy and wasn't feeling my high level of anxiety which generally happens in these kind of situation. I decided I am going to make to make a move this time. I had promised myself in the summer that I'll try and break my virginity in my last year of law school. I waited for an appropriate moment in which she wasn't occupied too much by her friends. I saw an opening and started walking towards her, she was making her drink from the bottle which was on the ground. I stopped 3 ft away from she turned saw me and smiled like she was expecting me. She turned her head again and i just froze. I couldn't utter a word, and after standing there for like 5 seconds without saying anything. I just walked of from their. I cursed by my self for being so pathetic and thought about going back in the college. But i decided to calm myself and try once again because i was really interested in this girl. I smoke a cigarette, muster all the courage and started walking towards her again, this time she was standing with her friend who were both dancing on rap. I stopped she saw me then started looking at her friend. I am feeling extremely nervous right now but i fight it and after 3 seconds i say "" I am sorry for earlier, i just got nervous"" in a very shaky voice. She responded ""it's okay you don't have to worry about that"" in a very soft tone. I ask her name tell her mine then shook her hand. Another friend of her came thinking that i was making her friend uncomfortable. Her friend who came, starts looking at me in a very suspicious way because it could be interpreted by my face that i was on some hard Drugs ( which i think the girl who i approached also figured out) my anxiety shoot up the roof and i wasn't able to utter even an alphabet. I froze again and walked of again, this time for real. I had a very bad trip after this incident and kept cursing myself for being a losser. I seriously need help as to how to overcome my social anxiety and be self- confident, that why i gave a detailed description of myself. I also got to know that the girl i approached is a mutual friend of a guy freind of mine and he has recommended me to send a insta request and start chatting with her. I want your opinion weather i should send her a request or i should just forget about her",2

I would also just chill outside a lot and probably do mushrooms/LSD. What I think you should do is really think about how fortunate you are. Sure you have some issues, but so does everyone else. It might be cliche, but think about children in third world countries. I mean... really think and try and imagine how their lives are. They don't have the outlets that we do to express their issues. They live with them every day. A lot of them don't have access to fresh water, or a consistent supply of food. Children starve to death!

Even if I feel anxious af, doesn't mean they can read my mind, they don't know what's going on in my mind, and even if, even if it obviously shows, they'll probably find it cute or appreciate my efforts or say to themselves ""wow, this dude likes me so much that he's really trying"". It's still there but it won't stop me (most of the times, sometimes) from doing what I want to do. And one of the best things happened to me when I suppressed my fears. (Some stupid things happened as well, but... that's to be expected...). Perhaps you don't necessarily want to approach girls at the beach... you can do it wherever you want; I do it when and where I feel (to a certain degree) comfortable and confident. And make it look natural. Go to your natural habitat (bookstore, college library, some coffee shop whatever...) and start a normal conversation. What works for me is to look at what we have in common... oh you're in that class, well what do you think about that and that..., you're reading that too? I read it too... I was thinking about reading that. I usually read stuff like that, but I heard these are good. What do you read..). And don't expect it to happen either... you might go out and don't talk to any girl... don't fore it but don't let the chance escape you either... it must be natural... if you really don't have anything to say to her, then don't.

I chased him for 5 minutes around people's gardens and driveways until I finally caught him and looked up to see about 4 people plus the delivery guy looking at me and laughing. The delivery guy gave me the parcel and I went inside with my dog. When I got inside i couldn't breath and I felt like I was dying. I don't know if it was a panic attack or not because I've never had one but I think it was caused by a mix of not going outside for about a week then suddenly going and doing that and the pain in my feet because I was just wearing socks when I was chasing him and I walked over sharp stones so they were bleeding. I don't really no what this post is but I really felt like I needed to rant after that.,2
dndki7,outside,"Birthday parties are the worst. Went to my best friends birthday party. I thankfully didn't need to introduce myself to everyoe because when I got there only her friends brother (family friends) and her brothers girlfriend were there (and my best friend and her mom) and I joined in on a card game, not saying a lot but definitely talking every now and then. Her niece came and everything was still great. But then her other friends came whom she knew way before we met, and everyone started talking and everything was loud and... I just sat there, eating snacks every now and then. I smiled a lot and just listened to everyone's conversations, but I didn't really chip in because whenever it's crowded like that I just get stuck. Sometimes people asked me something or included me in a conversation, but I'd say something for ten seconds and then it'd be back to just listening. I feel so embarrassed now. My best friend asked me multiple times whether everything was ok (not literally asked, more like thumbs up or down, because she knows I have bad social anxiety) and afterwards she went outside with me and told me she was really glad I came to her party even though I shouldn't have had to come, because she knew how hard this was for me. She told me she was really proud of me and that she was impressed I managed to stay for so long (which I did because it was too loud and I didn't know how I had to say that I wanted to leave so when everything fell silent I took my chance and said I was tired and was gonna leave), but that we could have also just gone out the two of us for her birthday. I definitely don't think she's mad or anything at me, but I'm really scared now that 1. She thinks I had a horrible time, which I didn't. I felt awkward the whole time, sure, but I like listening to people talk and everyone was really nice 2. That everyone, especially her old friends, thought I was being weird. I am dying inside ok bye",2
dnw0jj6,outside," Be outside alone (I have to be accompanied by people who help me, or a family member). Study, depression stops studying at home to be possible. Work and look for a job. Contact old friends and be with them. Play multiplayer video games, that judge scare exists even online for me. Speak to Internet friends, I have to be real drunk to dare start a conversation. Due to my stutter I think it's pretty impossible for me to get a girlfriend, but I don't want any kids anyway so. Pretty much everything outside at home and a pretty large part of the Internet. ",2

Trust me, I know it’s hard, but try to go to a gym, or resign up for fitness classes at your school/university gym or any other way you ca. The first time will be terrifying but once you’ve done it the first time, you’ll start wanting to go more. My fitness classes are the only thing that help me with my depression. ",2
do6c4cu,"walk, running","I don't have any advice, sorry, I just wanted to thank you for this post. After reading about it again I think I might have it, too. The funny thing is that I've already thought I had it around five years ago but I was hesitant (and still am) because ""personality disorder"" sounds like a whole other league than ""only"" anxiety. But the description of it fits me perfectly and much more than SA. I fit all the criteria from both ICD-10 and DSM-5 for AvPD. Just a few days ago I wondered why something like extreme self-consciousness wasn't classified as a disorder. What I think is one of the biggest differences is that I usually don't feel actual fear/panic (with shivering, fast heartbeat, sweating etc.). I've only had one panic attack so far and it wasn't during a social setting. I'm very tense in public, but I wouldn't call it afraid. Like you, I'm estranged to my whole family and I even had a close friend who I suddenly couldn't talk to normally anymore, like she was a stranger but she really wasn't. I became suicidal when I was told at an (involuntary) internship that I smiled too little and that people complained about me because of it. I get wasted on days I feel like people dislike me (like when coworkers don't sit down next to me at work, or ignore me when I ask a question). And after trying to unsuccessfully socialise at work for a week, I fell back into my cold/distant self and do awkward stuff like walking 10 meters behind my coworkers on my way to work, instead of running up to them, because I don't want to annoy them or get the feeling they're annoyed by me. I don't know - maybe I do have SA and not AvPD after all. I think AvPD describes me way better, but the two disorders are so similar it's a bit confusing. I should bring it up with my therapist.",2

I asked this guy who is friends with a mutual guy friend of mine if he could help me with my chemistry college class. He said sure and he has helped me a few times. I jokingly kissed him on the cheek once and he smiled and chuckled. One time we were kind of flirting and I put my hand on top of his and he held it. We just sat there kind of nervously looking at each other and chuckling. He was kind of biting his lip; kind of like he wanted to say or do something but he didn't know what he should do. I texted him and asked him if he wants to go to this park where you go hiking and he said yes. Do you think he likes me? Should I try to kiss him on the lips? If so, what is the best approach? He is 28 and I'm 24. What should we do when we go to the park? I want to kiss him but at the same time it might backfire and end up straining our friendship or maybe something good could come from it idk.

dq8p2as,outside," I've traveled solo in Japan during my exchange year there. I made sure I had a few places of interest to go to in each city I visited, I think that's pretty important when traveling alone. Depends on your personality of course, but for me going in without any kind of plan and just expecting to have a good time like that would have been a doomed attempt. Many times I wished I had a friend to go with, but at the same time I was happy to be able to go at my own pace and only to places I enjoyed, and to eat food I actually liked (as opposed to having to adapt to the tastes of other people when choosing restaurants and cafes) At one point I ended up having to spend the night in central Tokyo and unlike in my home country, the main train station was not open all night, so I had to spend some hours outside by myself which was a bit unnerving but it ended up being just fine luckily. Having someone with you is going to be more safe, so you'll want to take that into consideration when making plans. That some things might be dangerous or unwise to do all on your own. But that's kind of obvious probably. Sadly I missed my only chance of making new friends on that trip by feeling terribly nauseated one day and having to decline when a fellow tourist asked me out for coffee on the street. Despite not really meeting new people on my trip, I had a lot of new experiences and fun too. ",2
dq9zcev,camp,"Have before used a couple therapists, but often felt it was time consuming and too expensive for my parents if they even wanted to go that route anymore. I was actually sent away to a wilderness camp (Elements in Utah) for 9 weeks about a couple years ago so therapy has left a very sour taste in my mouth. If you dont know what that is, it's basically like being taken away in the middle of the night not knowing where the fuck you are going. Worst 9 weeks of my life, didnt get much out of it at all. But my mom had mentioned medication before and we never actually tried that route. I just hate to be dependent on a drug to make myself better in public. I already smoke too much BHO and started drinking hard liquor recently to make life enjoyable. Used to pop lots of pills (xans, molly, percocet) so would rather fix this from the source than becoming reliant on some pill to make my life better. Thanks for your input tho friend",2
dqadrzf,nature," Well, my exchange year was definitely the most lonely and isolated in my whole life at that point in time, so you're not alone in that. But that loneliness forced me to finally admit it to myself and started the progress that finally made me get help with my depression and anxiety. I try to see this positive side to it. And I'd chosen a country the culture of which I was interested in so I suppose I had that going for me. At the time it was socially terrible though, literally everyone else was making all these friends and I had none. I was always alone. Even had to admit that out loud a ton of times when in the oral exams for the local language the teacher made me say things like 'My best friend here is X' etc and I told her I had none but since I had to say someone's name for the sake of the exam, I went with the person who'd done the exam right before me. It was a private exam so it's not like that person ever heard me say it. I can relate to depression making things seem a million times less compelling, but there are things that you can do now that you probably can't once you return, and perhaps you could see about doing those. Such as seeing for yourself the local nature and events and attractions. Or trying out local delicacies, if those exist. In any case, try to hang in there and there's absolutely nothing wrong with you (or if there is, then we have that in common) for not having the most advertised and media-sexy exchange year experience.

dqaequ8,"hikes, walk","I want to add that for me there’s several tiers of traveling activities, from least fun to most fun. 0. Going on guided tours — it’s usually so boring for me! I would never do this again. 1. Shopping and eating at famous restaurants. Problem is that it’s hard to keep going while carrying all that stuff and sitting down to eat takes too much time that could be spent on more interesting activities. 2. Going on hikes and visit famous attractions. Might be a let down when you actually see those places but at least now you know what people were raving about. 3. Just walk around randomly for a day off the beaten path and take breaks at coffee shops. At night go to bars and clubs and talk to strangers. What better way to learn about another culture than a first hand experience of talking to locals? Of course this is very scary as someone with SA.

dqal4as,camp, Yeah that camp felt like being stuck with a group of annoying people in the middle of nowhere. But I think I might try giving therapy another shot with a good person one on one. They might have something to offer and shit what do I have to lose (besides $$). Thanks for your concern ,2
dqng08s,"outside, bike"," Very similar experience to you. I have just recently finished my final year of high school and I don't have a job, so there is nothing to do all day but to sit around home and wait for the day to end. This has been going on for a couple weeks now, my average day consists of nothing but watching YouTube videos, doing the house work, and reading reddit posts. Once every couple days, I make the effort to go outside and go on a two and a half hour bike ride just for the sake of getting some exercise, but other than that I don't often leave the house. Other than exercise, there is absolutely nothing to justify the expenditure of going outside. There is no money to spend, there are no friends to talk or catch up with, and there are no places which I want to visit. I don't even go with my parents anywhere, because I can't be bothered changing into something suitable. That pretty much sums it up, and with the future looking bleak, it seems like this will continue well into next year. I have a deep feeling that if this cycle was to continue unimpeded for another couple weeks, I will probably get depressed or something. It is truly a downward spiral, and it is all because of my anxiety and low self-esteem. ",2

Every now and then a teacher would come by and tell me that I was in out of bounds area and I had to move. So I just moved to a different location. I did not participate in any of the events at all, if I did so then my attempt would have been pitiful anyway. Luckily because i was a senior, I was able to leave early.

We also talked about the fact that I hate awkward silent and it make me nervous, she said she actually like the silent, and from that moment I didn't really felt awkward when there was silent. we dated for one more time and then we splitted up because this wasn't a match, but she was a good girl and a good first person to date.",2

ds4id6m,outdoors," There's a hundred things I could share with you here, but if you feel you have no purpose, it can be valuable to try and take some time and map out a few things: Expectations, the ones you have for yourself and the ones you think others have for you. Are there any that make you go 'I should want this, but I'm not sure if I actually do'? Values, that you have for yourself. What kind of things in life REALLY make a difference for you? In an ideal world with no expectations, what kind of person would you want to be known as? Core talents: what sort of games would you play, what sort of activities would you do, all by yourself, unprompted, when you were a very young child (think four, five, maybe six years old), before you had much awareness of what others wanted? Examining these things in more detail can give you a clue on what kinds of things give you energy, what sort of tricky things you love to do that not everyone else might enjoy just as much. Did you love reading books, fiction or factual? Did you ever act our stories with your toys? Did you ever step up and teach the other kids a new game? Did you like board games or solo puzzle games? Did you like exploring outdoors? Things like that. Anything you really did NOT like, too? ",2

That summer I worked at a fast food restaurant, whenever I was on the register I would talk to the customers, that was excellent practice, if I didn't feel like talking I could just stick to the script (would you like fries with that) if I did feel like talking I'd chat for a bit while taking there order. I noticed that customers liked talking to me and that helped my confidence in talking. When school started back up I finally started talking to whoever I sat next to, not because I had to, but because I wanted to.

duwj39,"run, walk","Noticed​ I've been staying at home a lot the last couple days. Advice?. Hi, I've noticed I haven't left the house much in the last couple of days apart from to get food, so spend like an hour out the house and then come back. I'm working on Fiverr atm and making quite a lot of money from it, much more then a 9/5 job would give me. And its freelance so I can set my hours etc. I guess my question is a two part thing. The first thing is that i'm aware that my job working from home in my music studio is quite isolating, but also if im more comfortable working this way and am making way more then a 9/5 anyway do I really need a 9/5? I still go out and socialise and see my mates on the weekend at least, but most of my days im alone working and then go out for nights out if im invited. My days atm basically is mostly making music for people all day and then I try and get out for a run or go to the shops for an hour or so in between. But sometimes if my mates don't have work they will invite me to stuff and ill go. Second part of the question is does anyone else do this? like find themselves staying at home a lot. Like say if there's a day where I don't have work to do id still choose to stay at home and chill instead of go and walk around the city aimlessly. Like if I don't have a plan ill just spend my day at home.

I can only speak for UberEats, not Postmates or Door Dash (though I’ve heard they’re pretty good). When a restaurant requests a driver/courier, you hear a ping and see how far away it is “11 minutes away”. You have ten seconds to accept or decline the order. If you choose to accept the order you press the icon and receive GPS directions to the restaurant. When you arrive, you press the “pick up” button in the app, which may contain special instructions like “Stand under pickup sign”. Check the customer’s name and order. Go inside and either wait by the pickup counter if there is one. Say something like “I’m picking up an UberEats order for John.” Once you’re ready to deliver, the app will give directions to the customer. Sometimes they may be hard to find if they order from an apartment building or workplace, so just call them if you have trouble locating them. Sometimes you get free food if you can’t find them and they won’t respond to calls. I think it’s great that you have a bike so you don’t have to spend money on gasoline.

dyo0kl,"outside, walk, run","How social anxiety ruined my life. Hi there reddit, since i am not a native English speaker i'll be using Google Translaitor. I am not seeking for help or life advice i just want to talk. I am 20 and half years old and only now i realised how completely i ruined my life because of the anxiety. And there is no way out for me. As far as I remember myself, I was always a rather shy and closed child, I did not go out outside unnecessarily. My first friends (and the only ones) appeared in my 5th grade. I well remember how we met, it was some kind of event and a couple of guys from my class came up to me and we just started chatting about everything - games, films, football, we chatted for at least two hours and then headed home and exchanged each other with console games. And in my opinion, it was a lot easier to communicate with strangers then. Secondary school, and then in my opinion the first problems appeared. When the homework was a pubic presentation or recitation of a verse by heart, I never completed these homewroks, as a result of which I got F grade and I had to hope only that in future we would no longer have such tasks, I was also afraid to go to the teacher and give me an individual task. In high school, the situation did not change, I was still afraid of public speaking and did not leave home unnecessarily, and when friends called for a walk, I always said that I was busy. A quick fact, in all my life I have never been to a cafe, to the cinema i wasnt even in a store alone. If I needed something, I asked my parents or sister to buy me. In 2016, I passed the exams and entered the pedagogical university at the Faculty of Philology, this was one of the biggest mistakes in my life. Due to the fact that I did not really care about where to go, I had to quickly choose the direction. I had to move from countryside to city (not to far tho, about 130 kms) and learn to live on my own, buy groceries, pay utility bills and most importantly communicate with people, from that moment I no longer saw my friends live, both moved to other cities. Speaking of classes at the university, each English class needed to stand in front of the audience and tell the learned text, there were also quite often group work, and if I could barely cope with the first example, then when we worked in groups I was ready to disappear, run away , do anything if only I were not here, cause i simply cant talk to people which i dont know, My palms and forehead began to sweat. No kidding, when I reached the bus stop and went to the university, for me it was a real challenge. What makes me even more anxious is that there were 22 girls and 6 boys in the group keying me. I went through anxiety for two months until one day I decided not to go to university, and from that moment on, my life went awry. I began to skip classes more and more, sleep problems started, I went to bed at 8 in the morning, and got up at 7 in the evening and my parents didnt even know about this situation. With bad points, but I still went through the first semester. But in the second situation did not change, I was not at the university for exactly a month and none of my classmates, headmen or curator were interested in what happened to me. By the way, in January 2017, I stopped talking with one of my friends, the communication just broke due to some little trifle I don’t even want to mention it. April 2017, the curator told his parents that I did not attend classes, but I in turn made promises that I would attend classes. One day, after a long absence in class, the curator called me to his place and began to ask me what was happening to me, I had good points for the first months of my studies, and then everything went awry. After the conversation, she advised me to turn to a psychologist, but I immediately rejected this idea, although now, I understand that it might be worth giving this idea a chance. Even the girls from the group offered me their help, but I refused, i decided that it will be extremley hard to comeback.I just don’t have the courage to approach the teacher and ask for additional classes. As a result i was expelled from university. While I was in the city alone, I talked a lot about what to do next. They set me up as an example for my sister, laid more hopes on me, but I just didn’t live up to these hopes, I myself was not in awe of myself, I considered myself miserable and that there was no place for me like this in this world, so I decided that the best option there will be suicide. I decided to hang myself in the closet and when I felt cramps and lack of oxygen, a stupid thought crept into my head and said to me “Do not do this, give yourself a chance”. Now, I really regret that I succumbed to that thought and did not finish what it would be worth In September 2017, I entered college and again, in November 2017, I was expelled. Classical history, anxiety, unwillingness to leave the dorm room due to loneliness, although I understand that I had to go to college and university not for communication, but for education. For almost 2 years now I have been living with my parents in the village, I leave the house only to throw snow from the yard, I haven’t been talking with my last friend since January 2019. My younger sister graduated from college, works and receives money, while I just sit on the neck of the parents. Guess, i messed up my life, opportunities, goal and there is nothing i can do about it. I dont watch movies, series, anime, sometimes playing games but right now nothing interests me, i just lay down on the bed and thinking about my pasy and what i have done. Last year I tried to start all over again at the university but I didn’t have 3 points to enter.

Which then makes them uncomfortable which then they flee. I remember I used to be popular back then and I could talk to almost anyone anxiety free. Now that I look back i think I did have underlying effects of SA. I could talk normally, I had friends, I could do presentations, talk on the phone, I did extra activities, talk to teachers, have fun, ect. But now looking back i do remember sometimes where that wasn’t the case. Sometimes I would hide in the bathroom to change clothes. I wouldn’t talk to other kids until a friend walked in to summer camp/class. I would get really uncomfortable if I was in a certain groups or usually when I sat next to certain women (I would try to act cool or some shit). I think I just somehow broke later on in life and my anxiety shut me down. Now back to my point. I agree with you people do treat you better when you don’t have SA even if you were a little nervous or “shy” like me. ",2

So if you can find work somewhere, even a grocery store... you might find people there who you like being around and a friendship can bloom.

When I was 20 my besfriend broke up with her long term bf and started geting closer to me and then confessed that she loved me and I already had a tiny crush on her so we decided to try it out ( didnt last long ) we went on 3 diffrent dates. First date we just went to the movies and later ate at a restaurant and walked around after that day she ghosted me for 2 weeks and then started talking to me again and said sorry and wanted to try again. Second date I went hiking with her and watched the sunset and ate at a pizza place after that day she avoided me for a few days with a bunch excuses then asked me out again and I was like sure. Third date we went to a restaurant then walked by the beach and saw the sunset she kissed me that night and told me why she avoided me all those days apperntly she was scared we would destroy our friendship and she already lost her bofriend and didnt wanna lose me too well I accepted her but few days later I went out with a cousin to watch some movies and a saw her walking with her neighboor (she told she was studying at home ) and then they started kissing they looked so inloved. It kinda hurt becuase she was my befriend and lied to me. But I grabbed my phone took a picture of them send it to her and told her with a message ""I just saw you And I dont think we can be friends anymore"" and I ghosted her after that I cut all contact with friends of hers and family (first time I ghosted someone). I like to tell myself its no big deal but it really hurts when someone you trust betrays you like that. This event isnt really the reason for my anxiety but it sure made a bit worse I think. I had a rough childhood parents were really aggrasive and both are introverts and when I was diagonesed with anxiety as a kid my parent decided to try not to fight in front of me anymore ( they didnt do a good job at it ) aslo tey started ignoring me becuase they thought they were toxic for me to be around them. So I grow up with introverted parents that argued violently in front of me and isolated me. Afcouse they werent bad parents they did the best that they good. They fucked me up mentally but I didnt starve, I have a home, education I am doing fine so they did great job and I love them for it.",2
e1suz2p,garden,I think it's kind of normal for people to watch other people in a non judging way.

Back at my old school we had an aftercare after school and since my mom worked late everyday, after school I would be there 24/7. This started from Kindergarten-8th grade. Which probably explains why I was decent at most sports. I agree with you on that one. Volleyball is an anxiety inducing sport. I was real bad because I couldn’t serve, I couldn’t set, and my wrist/arms hurt every time I hit the god damn ball. Like how tf do girls deal with that. It’s real bad especially if the other team targets you because your the weak one in the team. Some other examples of anxiety in sports that I’ve felt looking back. When your playing football and you run out, you see the quarterback and he looks at you and then ignores you and continues with the play. Or he finally decides to throw it to you and sadly the catch is not received. Especially embarrassing if your wide-open :/ Same with baseball, someone would hit a pop fly out to me and I would usually miss and have to throw it in. The shame, the shameeee. The rest I would just try to make jokes on them I would feel the anxiety but I wasn’t scared of doing the sports. I was scared of failure and of losing. I was real competitive back then. It was like a different anxiety back then. When I got into hs though I didn’t make any sports teams lol and my anxiety was through the roof. Lol that’s pretty funny looking back at it. I would definitely hate though if I was in that position and someone said “tough luck” to me.",2

To the point that I was eventually going to the gym everyday. Anyway, long story short I met a guy whilst at the gym and I'd say we became friends. He was a regular at the gym I went to and kindly helped me with getting used to working out and how to do everything correctly. We got on well since we both had similar interests and he had dealt with mental health issues as well so he seemed to be very patient and understanding with me. We would see each other almost everyday at the gym and work out together regularly. Although not many conversations were had since neither of us were overly talkative. But whenever we did I almost felt lost. It seemed like a huge challenge just to think of something to say and I'm sure there were many times when I was unintentionally offensive or inappropriate. I think about conversations I've had days ago or even years ago. What could I have done differently? Maybe if I was more talkative or showed some emotion I'd still have friends? Around 6-7 months after meeting him I kind of just woke up one morning and felt like it had all been a huge lie. Since when am I able to talk to people or go outside on a regular basis?

Maybe walking outside and talking to a random woman would be too hard for you, so do something else that’s less scary. I’ve heard that creating a list of everything that gives you anxiety helps. Start from the thing that gives you the least and anxiety and work your way up. If smiling to a stranger gives you anxiety but not enough as much as other actions, challenge yourself to start with that. Climb the latter. For me, saying good morning to people was hard for me, but the more I forced myself to do it, the more I became comfortable with it. Now I can do it without much anxiety. I’m still a very anxious and awkward person but I know that in order to get better, I need to put myself in a position TO get better. Doing something you thought you couldn’t is an amazing feeling. I understand how you feel completely but it’s really the only way. If you were to ask for professional help, they’d tell you the same exact thing.

She'd sit on the ground outside with me during lunch all the damn time (especially when I was alone), one of her friends asked me if I liked her (which I gave an incredibly oblivious and vague answer to because I didn't catch on at the time) and this one we briefly yet meaningfully held hands. We were in the high school's ""Who's Who"" section in the yearbook as the Shyest Boy/Girl 2 or 3 years in a row, and took a cool picture that we dressed up for together. But I didn't really press it any further. I tried to will myself to make a move, any move, but I was too scared. My subconscious held me back. So she moved on, got a boyfriend of her own. I don't think she's with him anymore, but I still haven't seen her since high school - I don't know if I'll ever see her again. So rage against your subconscious thoughts telling you to be quiet because it's worth taking that chance of rejection. If I saw her again, I'd tell her how I felt about her back then.",2
friv42k,walk,"Once when I was out for a walk with my headphones,a kid asked me what time it is. I had my headphones on so I didn’t hear if he said auntie or didi(a term for girls older than you). I told him the time and walked away. But I was literally crying inside whether he called me auntie or didi because it made me self anxious and till this day I am thinking of what he called me. By the way I am 16",2
fvpl47y,"park, runs, run"," I was in cross country in highschool and our coach would take us to a local park for our runs. There he taught us that it is very common to say ""Good Morning, afternoon, evening"" when you pass by people. He said to just -WAVE- to passer Byers when we were on our faster run where we had to focus more on hitting a time so we can still be respectful. A rule for eye contact and also greeting strangers is when being approached or approaching a stranger you make eye contact and if they don't immediately look away then say hello or hey (whatever feels natural to you) ",2
fyjtwg1,walk," That’s exactly what we’re doing, eating some icecream while taking a walk. And thanks for the great advice, i should maybe also just take this as sort of a learning experience instead of having all kinds of expectations. :) ",2
