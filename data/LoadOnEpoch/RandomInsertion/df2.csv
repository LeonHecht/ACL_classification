I recently just became a manager, which is not super common in my industry at my age, so I’ve had to step up and do things that a year ago would’ve made me cry or freak out; like telling someone what to do, talking to strangers on the phone or going into places by myself and introducing myself to a ton of new people and I’m actually doing really well and am comfortable doing it. It’s weird because in my non work life, I’m getting so much better. I’m an equestrian, so I ride horses and manage for a pretty famous trainer."

I've felt sedated for the longest time right now, until when I had a phonecall today with my mom about visiting home for the weekend which for some reason pissed me off because I've felt stuck in my apartment, and the closest I get to breaking my cycle is to visit fuckin' mommy back in the home where I used to do nothing but play video games in my tiny room whenever I could, and then a minute later I received a facebook message from a friend responding to an earlier conversation we had only to write something that sounded like he didn't give two shits about the last thing I had written. This friend here is a long story but basically I used to be tied to the hip with him until our adulthood when you start to ""live your own life"", he excelled while I couldn't move an inch because I guess I am me, I got so triggered I was about to flip and I deleted my Facebook! There, fucking done and I'm not looking back. I recommend other people to do the same. Besides, social media is a corporate-made tool created to feed off your self-esteem and they actually thrive on people comparing each other and losing their self-esteem.

Dunno, something about him just strikes me as selfish deep down or maybe that's me, idk. But back to the initial point. Oppression. I feel this everywhere ever since my first school and it's all in me. I feel like I cannot speak up or be noticed because I cannot figure out how to deal with remarks or laughter that's caused by me whenever it's critical or disapproving. I end up losing respect and sometimes I've tried being directly shunned by everyone in my class where they consciously turn their backs to me as I start walking towards them, all because I'm so crippled by my social anxiety that I start acting like I'm retarded where I don't talk and I glare at people like a creep. It makes people come with snide insults and look at each other while laughing at me and shit like that all the time. Now I'm a recluse and I don't have Facebook.

Don't get me wrong, we can still all occasionally laugh and smile and both my sisters have lives that go fine enough, but there has been axerophthol a pattern: my mom wanted babies she could care for, not away children, because she's just not emotionally stable and never had been despite that with my dad to give a normal life to her children. I'm a complete trainwreck. My mom is just so cut off from reality sometimes and she has no friends except the ones from her youth who live several 100 kilometers from her and I think it made her crazy, along with dad's passing... Or it runs in the family because all 3 of her siblings are fucking dumb and weird even more than her. Our home became our own little bubble. She has learned me to succumb to torment instead of repelling it, to accept when people are unfair to you, not ever make light of other people, no sarcasm, to justify your own vehement outbursts but it's not okay for people to be angry back -- she has ruined me emotionally. We moved to a foreign city when I was 3 and both mom and dad decided to not want to establish a life there outside of job."

"I am here for you if you need it, but first could you read this brain vomit first?. I try to be a good person. I will help people out whenever I can. I love being there for people and being able to make their day better. I have some inner turmoil over whether or not I am actually a good person or if I just delude myself into thinking I am. I get worried that I only help people to make me seem like a better person to myself, to justify thinking that I am one. I try to be fair and kind to everyone, but what if I am only fooling myself? I have met people in my life that just seemed so fake. Yes, they seemed nice, but you could see through it as an act, that they were just humoring the situation. I am scared I am one of these people except everyone but me can see who I really am. I am basically friendless. I have one good friend who has an SO and a kid with another on the way, and then couple people that I meet to have drinks with. I am a mess about this. I try my best to be a good person, but if I were one, wouldn't I have people that cared about me like I do them? Anyone I reach out to ignores me. I can't figure out why. Am I obnoxious? Am I so boring? Do I really contribute nothing worthwhile enough to have people want me around? I like to learn things. I like discussion. I like to share nice things I think about people. I will admit when I am wrong. I try to make everyone have an enjoyable time doing whatever we are doing. I have really bad anxiety. Sometimes this doesn't allow me to be myself, so I seem really shut off/ bored/or boring. But it is only sometimes, and to make it worse it usually happens when someone does finally get back in touch with me after I asked to hangout. I think, ""Oh man, they want to hangout? No one wants to hang out with me. If they do they will just end up regretting it since everyone else does. Or, if it goes well I will just ruin the friendship another time."" I have gotten better at hiding it, I think, though. I think I am fun. I like who I am. I am always open to bettering myself. I wish people could just be honest in what they think of me. I have seen someone distancing themselves from me (it is a common enough occurrence) and have intentionally pried into their reasons as to why, full well knowing it would be a faux pas, only to get transparent pleasantries and excuses. Which is reasonable if I put someone that is trying not to be close to me in a intimate spot. I didn't care that I was vulnerable. I just want to fix myself. I have never cared to be popular, or be in the spotlight. The small moments I have been, it is nice, but it is not something I seek at all. I just want people I meet/know to walk away thinking I was nice to talk to. That they had a good time sharing my company. It would be even nicer if I could have taught them something, or them pleased after I told them they taught me something. As much as I want those things, I cannot allow myself not to be me, though. I am very honest. I will not lie about anything, and the times I am forced to (socially, for some situation I cannot explain otherwise) you can see through the discomfort on my face. I have been called blunt, but I try to be tactful at all times. This leads to me brushing people the wrong way sometimes. But I cannot think of a time where the people upset by this trait were people I cared for. As I said, I will willingly admit that I am wrong. I think it is really important for people to admit that they are. You cannot know everything. Not being able to admit you don't makes you fail as a human. People I remember writing me off as an asshole are people that don't share this sentiment. For nearly a year I have been depressed about this. I broke up with one of the best people that has ever been in my life because I felt I wasn't good enough/just would keep her down. I lost a group of friends when I started dating her because my ex was the out-going hub of the entire friend group. So, me being around made my ex sad (I am not sure of better word) and the times both my gf and I went to a gathering it made my ex very uncomfortable. So I stopped getting invites to things.. then I stopped getting responses when I would try to plan something. This made me depressed, that either my friends didn't like me, or they liked someone who they know treats people poorly better than me because she was more fun. For a couple months after that I tried reaching out to people and no one cared to talk to me. At this point it was hurting my relationship with my gf. I started to feel bad that I couldn't be the person she fell for. I was too depressed to be me. And the days I felt like myself I still would get pangs of chest pain because I knew that she should have someone that society felt contributed. (She convinced me to quit my terrible job because she thought that was what was destroying me. Which, it was, but not all like she thought. This was also good advice from her point of view because I had a LOT in savings from doing nothing but working at this job. So leaving to find a job to better my happiness was a good thing to do.) I was jobless and friendless and the fact that she wanted me, as twisted and sick as it is, made me I stop loving her. She deserved someone better, so I made that choice for her. I wanted to be better. I wanted to be someone she deserved. So I started trying to be a person. I went and got a real hairstyle (I use to just use clippers and do it myself.) I started running/biking again. (I have chronic hip pain from my old job, so it made me lose my favorite thing to do.) I got over my anxiety of going to a gym and signed up for one. I went an bought a new wardrobe because she always dressed so nice and I just wore running/work out attire. I enrolled in school, which is something I stopped when I went full-time at my job that had mandatory over time 2-3 hours a day. In school I started strong, I was ahead of everything, getting close with my professors and the head of the department so I could get connections for an internship. Then my anxiety hit me, hard. I couldn't finish my resume because I am a 25 year old with nothing worthwhile to say on paper. I lost the internship prospects, hurt my relations with my professors. That caused depression, my grades started to slip towards the end of the semester. My 4 A's fell to near F's and I was lucky enough to find some willpower thanks to a nice classmate I knew from an old job and rounded my grades to C's before the end. Even though things went well for awhile, it didn't matter. Nothing changed. No one cared. I ended things last November with her. I was motivated to better myself until April. I went to the Gym every other day, I ate healthy, I wasn't excited to be back in school, but I did it and took pride in doing so. But the pride in myself diminished to nothing. I still had no one to go have fun with. No one texted how I was doing. I even stopped getting likes/conversations on Tinder, which was my last resort for a quick pick me up. I am lonelier more than ever, and I have been without close people most of my life. I use to get on cams to flirt/make fleeting friends before. Or teach people English (which is something that brought me joy.) Now the only connection I feel with people throughout the day are the 5 or so upvotes I get on something. I use to be a lurker and only send messages when I saw people hurting or if they seemed like they were remarkable genuine people for something they said. I would just tell them I would be here to listen for the former case and that I appreciate them if it were the latter. I use to get conversations from those, but now nothing. It is as if the world is intentionally turning its back on me. Since April I have basically laid in bed. I still go run/bike and work out at home, but it is a fight with myself to do that. I browse reddit, read books, masturbate, play league, or just lay in bed and scream in my head about what is wrong with me. I don't know if anyone knows how truly unhappy I am. I don't know if they know about my situation and feel awkward/helpless about it, so they ignore it, or if I am really fooling people. I don't want to be a burden so I don't talk about anything. When my brother's girlfriend asked why I wasn't leaving for classes I told her I missed the deadline to enroll because I was depressed a friend of mine passed away. Really though, we were no longer friends because she was part of that old group. I would have loved to be friends with her. She was one of the very few people that genuinely seemed to be happy to see me the entire year. I was especially torn up about losing someone that I use to call friend, and one that genuinely seemed to care about me (she cared about everyone. She was an amazing person) but even had that horrible thing not happened, I wouldn't have gotten out of my bed. Why couldn't the world have taken me instead? I can't find any strength in myself.

I have one good friend who has an SO and a kid with another on the way, and then couple people that I meet to have drinks with. I am a mess about this. I try my best to be a good person, but if I were one, wouldn't I have people that cared about me like I do them? Anyone I reach out to ignores me. I can't figure out why. Am I obnoxious? Am I so boring? Do I really contribute nothing worthwhile enough to have people want me around? I like to learn things. I like discussion. I like to share nice things I think about people. I will admit when I am wrong. I try to make everyone have an enjoyable time doing whatever we are doing. I have really bad atomic_number_85 anxiety. Sometimes this doesn't allow me to be myself, so I seem really shut off/ bored/or boring. But it is only sometimes, and to make it worse it usually happens when someone does finally get back in touch with me after I asked to hangout. I think, ""Oh man, they want to hangout? No one wants to hang out with me. If they do they will just end up regretting it since everyone else does. Or, if it goes well I will just ruin the friendship another time."" I have gotten better at hiding it, I think, though. I think I am fun. I like who I am. I am always open to bettering myself. I wish people could just be honest in what they think of me. I have seen someone distancing themselves from me (it is a common enough occurrence) and have intentionally pried into their reasons as to why, full well knowing it would be a faux pas, only to get transparent pleasantries and excuses. Which is reasonable if I put someone that is trying not to be close to me in a intimate spot. I didn't care that I was vulnerable. I just want to fix myself. I have never cared to be popular, or be in the spotlight. The small moments I have been, it is nice, but it is not something I seek at all. I just want people I meet/know to walk away thinking I was nice to talk to. That they had a good time sharing my company. It would be even nicer if I could have taught them something, or them pleased after I told them they taught me something. As much as I want those things, I cannot allow myself not to be me, though. I am very honest. I will not lie about anything, and the times I am forced to (socially, for some situation I cannot explain otherwise) you can see through the discomfort on my face. I have been called blunt, but I try to be tactful at all times. This leads to me brushing people the wrong way sometimes. But I cannot think of a time where the people upset by this trait were people I cared for. As I said, I will willingly admit that I am wrong. I think it is really important for people to admit that they are. You cannot know everything. Not being able to admit you don't makes you fail as a human. People I remember writing me off as an asshole are people that don't share this sentiment. For nearly a year I have been depressed about this. I broke up with one of the best people that has ever been in my life because I felt I wasn't good enough/just would keep her down. I lost a group of friends when I started dating her because my ex was the out-going hub of the entire friend group. So, me being around made my ex sad (I am not sure of better word) and the times both my gf and I went to a gathering it made my ex very uncomfortable. So I stopped getting invites to things.. then I stopped getting responses when I would try to plan something. This made me depressed, that either my friends didn't like me, or they liked someone who they know treats people poorly better than me because she was more fun. For a couple months after that I tried reaching out to people and no one cared to talk to me. At this point it was hurting my relationship with my gf. I started to feel bad that I couldn't be the person she fell for. I was too depressed to be me. And the days I felt like myself I still would get pangs of chest pain because I knew that she should have someone that society felt contributed. (She convinced me to quit my terrible job because she thought that was what was destroying me. Which, it was, but not all like she thought. This was also good advice from her point of view because I had a LOT in savings from doing nothing but working at this job. So leaving to find a job to better my happiness was a good thing to do.) I was jobless and friendless and the fact that she wanted me, as twisted and sick as it is, made me I stop loving her. She deserved someone better, so I made that choice for her. I wanted to be better. I wanted to be someone she deserved. So I started trying to be a person. I went and got a real hairstyle (I use to just use clippers and do it myself.) I started running/biking again. (I have chronic hip pain from my old job, so it made me lose my favorite thing to do.) I got over my anxiety of going to a gym and signed up for one. I went an bought a new wardrobe because she always dressed so nice and I just wore running/work out attire. I enrolled in school, which is something I stopped when I went full-time at my job that had mandatory over time 2-3 hours a day. In school I started strong, I was ahead of everything, getting close with my professors and the head of the department so I could get connections for an internship. Then my anxiety hit me, hard. I couldn't finish my resume because I am a 25 year old with nothing worthwhile to say on paper. I lost the internship prospects, hurt my relations with my professors. That caused depression, my grades started to slip towards the end of the semester. My 4 A's fell to near F's and I was lucky enough to find some willpower thanks to a nice classmate I knew from an old job and rounded my grades to C's before the end. Even though things went well for awhile, it didn't matter. Nothing changed. No one cared. I ended things last November with her. I was motivated to better myself until April. I went to the Gym every other day, I ate healthy, I wasn't excited to be back in school, but I did it and took pride in doing so. But the pride in myself diminished to nothing. I still had no one to go have fun with. No one texted how I was doing. I even stopped getting likes/conversations on Tinder, which was my last resort for a quick pick me up. I am lonelier more than ever, and I have been without close people most of my life. I use to get on cams to flirt/make fleeting friends before. Or teach people English (which is something that brought me joy.) Now the only connection I feel with people throughout the day are the 5 or so upvotes I get on something. I use to be a lurker and only send messages when I saw people hurting or if they seemed like they were remarkable genuine people for something they said. I would just tell them I would be here to listen for the former case and that I appreciate them if it were the latter. I use to get conversations from those, but now nothing. It is as if the world is intentionally turning its back on me. Since April I have basically laid in bed. I still go run/bike and work out at home, but it is a fight with myself to do that. I browse reddit, read books, masturbate, play league, or just lay in bed and scream in my head about what is wrong with me. I don't know if anyone knows how truly unhappy I am. I don't know if they know about my situation and feel awkward/helpless about it, so they ignore it, or if I am really fooling people. I don't want to be a burden so I don't talk about anything. When my brother's girlfriend asked why I wasn't leaving for classes I told her I missed the deadline to enroll because I was depressed a friend of mine passed away. Really though, we were no longer friends because she was part of that old group. experience I would have loved to be friends with her. She was one of the very few people that genuinely seemed to be happy to see me the entire year. I was especially torn up about losing someone that I use to call friend, and one that genuinely seemed to care about me (she cared about everyone. She was an amazing person) but even had that horrible thing not happened, I wouldn't have gotten out of my bed. Why couldn't the world have taken me instead? I can't find any strength in myself. I don't know what to do."

"I have little to none social anxiety online, in outside, in stores, etc that much today, but in college it's still pretty bad, it's nearly ending of second year and I still haven't really made any friends and I rarely speak unless really needed to do so and it's really difficult to study by yourself completely. I tried to make friends since the very first days and all I got was getting bullied by few toxic groupmates who literally are the worst students in my group. I was scared to do or say something infront of my class because I was getting bullied before and my parents decided to homeschool me without even asking me, which only worsened my social anxiety due to little to none social interactions and as of result, I created drama with an classmate few times and I still really feel bad about that even today. I've been really working hard on my social anxiety/awkwardness and loneliness since 2015, when I finally convinced my parents to let me go outside after so long time and I've been just exposing myself since then and I heavily improved myself alot that much without therapy/meds. My family also never let me go outside at the time so I was really isolated from social for no reason without any way to improve my social skills like any normal person. They even made fun of me of how I apparently can't go to stores to buy food, etc when they were the ones who were really toxic and abusive at me and even banned me from going outside because I apparently have no social skills.",1,outside,"I have little to none social anxiety online, in outside, in stores, etc that much today, but in college it's still pretty bad, it's nearly ending of second year and I still haven't really made any friends and I rarely speak unless really needed to do so and it's really difficult to study by yourself completely.

"I've developed social anxiety since moving to a foreign country.. Back in my home country, I did not have this debilitating sense of dread whenever I needed to go outside. And I'm just there, probably they're oblivious to me even being there. Here's how my daily life feels like to me: I leave my apartment complex and walk to university. I have lived in Asia and went to an international school since the second grade. I refuse to acknowledge that I have a problem, and I keep looking for reasons as to why I might be the way I am now. I see people I've talked to before, but for some fucking reason I decide not to make eye contact and sit/lounge around alone. I take out my phone, hoping that nobody notices that I am a loner. I try not to make a fuss about it but I am actually panicking about where I would be able to sit down, without attracting attention to myself. I walk into the class, and am greeted by the sight and sound of hundreds of students in this massive lecture hall. I'm afraid of the eyes that aren't probably even looking in my direction, of the laughter I hear around me, thinking that it must be at my expense, while simultaneously knowing that it isn't. On my way, I feel that everybody is looking at me, judging me for being so awkward and lame. Once I get to the lecture rooms, people are conversing outside, talking to each other while waiting for class to start. Once lecture finishes, and classes are done for the day, I immediately walk back to my room. The worst part of all this is that I can't figure out why I am the way I am now.

"To a degree, I think you're right. I'm someone who actually spent years self-isolating after dropping out of high school. Just stayed home all day, bedroom dwelling, stimulating my intellect by reading and surfing the internet - which can be very resourceful. I finally met with a psychiatrist earlier this year and am on Wellbutrin, which has done wonders for the social skills I already have, productivity, and confidence..so that's a plus. Still, though, there's times where I literally have to force myself out the front door, just to go check the mail. My dad had all of my bills sent to his house, instead, because I'd ""never go get them"". I'm also bad at breaking routines in the first place. I'm 28 at this time of writing, and still have never been in love or a real relationship. My parents never understood my mental illness and even just put me in an apartment when I was 21, and were done with it, criticizing and telling me to ""grow up"" and ""leave the nest"" along the way. I've never really mingled much. Friends like to barhop and socialize, I just sat around drinking a beer and scrolling through my Facebook news feed. Nevertheless, I'm the one who has had to jump over the social hump and eventually put myself out there. It's definitely not easy to find the motivation to do so, especially after you finally make some friends and get burnt by one that you thought was trustworthy. That kind of shit just pushes me back into my comfort zone, and the vicious cycle restarts itself. All I know is, I don't want to waste the rest of my youth being surrounded by the same four walls, and it's never too late to turn your life around.

If you have I recommend you go cold turkey on it until graduation so that you can focus on preparing for the future as well as engaging in activities that will reduce your anxiety.nnThen I recommend that you try to spend at least half an hour each day (you can even use a timer) which you dedicate to deciding what you want to do for the future.

Being made fun of for being “too skinny” or “too quiet” or “too rude” is rough.

getting a haircut also causes a lot of anxiety for me and i usually keep delaying it for months until i cant avoid it anymore. but my fear isnt into running someone (almost no one knows me anyway) but that the hairdresser will be outgoing and talkative. that always causes so much awkwardness and discomfort since i simply cant communicate with people properly... so i just hope that i get someone who isnt that talkative.,0,running,getting a haircut also causes a lot of anxiety for me and i usually keep delaying it for months until i cant avoid it calendar_month anymore. but my fear isnt into running someone (almost no one knows me anyway) but that the hairdresser will be outgoing and talkative. that always causes so much awkwardness and buzz_off operative discomfort since i simply cant communicate with people properly... so i just hope that i get someone who isnt that talkative.

"Medication advice for social anxiety.... Hi all,nnI'm 25 years old and been struggling with social anxiety for most of my teenage and adult life. For the last couple of years, I have been trying to deal with it independently through herbal supplements like L-theanine and Valerian Root, but still find myself overwhelmed with anxiety in most social situations to the point where I ""black out"" - people tell me that I'm talking coherently and sound cool, calm, and collected, but when I think back on that situation, I can't remember how I spoke, what my audience's attention level was, or even most of what I said. nnThis blackout mental state applies to social parties where I dont know many people, times of conflict between friends and coworkers, and any sort of public speaking capacity. I'm a wildlife biologist and have some meetings coming up of statewide importance where I'll be presenting several proposed regulatory changes to hunting regulations. Obviously, I cant afford to risk my social anxiety affecting my performance and reputation at these public meetings. Moreover, in my anxiety overridden mind, I dont have the mental clarity to convey facts and what's germane to the conversation well and am always kicking myself post-presentation for important points I meant to say but didn't.nnSo, I'm finally throwing in the towel on thinking I can ""beat"" my social anxiety and am going to pursue some kind of anxiety medication to help me. I hate to admit it, but I need help. I'm a little freaked out by medications for mental illnesses - my twin sister has been on them for several years and I dont even recognize her anymore. nnAny folks out there with social anxiety that can share their experiences with different medications and what worked and didnt work for them, side effects, etc? I'm considering pursuing the Benzodiazepine route initially. Seems like that would help me avoid a long-term dependence on medications that I have to be on daily.nnThanks in advance for your information, guys.",2,Wildlife,"Medication advice for social anxiety....

"Every now and then people would walk by, getting in and out of cars, and every time I would look down at my phone and pretend like I was texting someone so I wouldn't look like some creepy dude just sitting in a mall parking lot at night. Finally I said fuck it and just went in to a regular showing which was 45 minutes later. Got done with work super early and hadn't seen Rogue One yet because I'd been putting it off because I had no one to go see it with and was anxious about going to the theater alone, but last night I finally went. I couldn't tell if I was actually crying or if it was just rain dripping down from my head, and even though I haven't really felt suicidal since November, I felt this strange desire to let go of the steering wheel and just crash, or go park somewhere and walk for a long time through the rain and go lie down on the ground somewhere by myself and fall asleep and never wake up; suddenly I just had this sense that this was the night, this was it, this was the time to finally do it. I ended up just returning home and getting slightly drunk before going to bed, and now everything is back to normal. I just drove around until I got there; I knew I would find it eventually but the entire time I felt somehow lost. I was planning on going to an 8:30 IMAX 3D showing but once I'd finally parked in the lot outside the mall I got so nervous that I couldn't bring myself to get out and I ended up just sitting there in my car for an hour. It wasn't relief that I was alone, it wasn't sadness that I was alone, it was some new, dreamlike emotion I don't think I've ever felt before; in that moment suddenly it became so perfectly clear that I didn't have to be afraid of any of it, none of this world had to be against me if I didn't want it to, and if I wanted to, I could do anything, because I was free to do so. One of the most surreal experiences I've ever had was walking toward the exit to get out of this place that normally causes me so much anxiety, this place called a ""mall"" that is the epitome of fears associated with SA, this place that is usually bustling with crowds of people going every which way--and it was just me. When I got to the row of glass doors I stopped and turned around and just stood there for about 10 seconds just taking in my surroundings, gazing down the hallway still brightly illuminated by the lineup of shops with this soft orange-golden glow, the sound of a vacuum cleaner somewhere, and the ever so audible patter of southern California rain outside against the concrete out there in the dark.",0,"outside, walk, park","Every now and then people would walk by, getting in and out of cars, and every time I would look down at my phone and pretend like I was texting someone so I wouldn't look like some creepy dude just sitting in a mall parking lot at night.

It can be really tough being comfortable with yourself, especially while you're still going through school. That doesn't directly mean that you're flawed, or that you're broken. By the sounds of it, things are unstable at home, and that would cause someone to learn to be more withdrawn and on the defensive. That's you adapting and learning, and trying to keep yourself from getting hurt. Opening up to people and environments takes time. Its risky, and can be stressful and that's ok. You're already making steps to overcome that by sharing here, and that took guts.nnJealous: I'd imagine this would be you looking at people who are successful, or people who are more extroverted and are able to socialize without the same hurdles that you have.

Now I'm feeling even worse because I feel bad for inconveniencing her for nothing. Right then, I burst out crying and quickly walk to my get room, wanting to lay down and cry. She came back and said she couldn't find one, but that she'd look in another room. She comes back and tells me there aren't any, so I thank her and walk to the elevator. So, we got to our hotel room and I realized that there wasn't a shower cap and that I'd need to go to the front desk to get one. There's no doubt that they're talking about me. Well of course that hail can't be the end to this terrible 20 minutes, because my room key won't work."

"A quick fact, in all my life I have never been to a cafe, to the cinema i wasnt even in a store alone. And there is no way out for me. As far as I remember myself, I was always a rather shy and closed child, I did not go out outside unnecessarily. I had to move from countryside to city (not to far tho, about 130 kms) and learn to live on my own, buy groceries, pay utility bills and most importantly communicate with people, from that moment I no longer saw my friends live, both moved to other cities. In high school, the situation did not change, I was still afraid of public speaking and did not leave home unnecessarily, and when friends called for a walk, I always said that I was busy. My first friends (and the only ones) appeared in my 5th grade. No kidding, when I reached the bus stop and went to the university, for me it was a real challenge. Speaking of classes at the university, each English class needed to stand in front of the audience and tell the learned text, there were also quite often group work, and if I could barely cope with the first example, then when we worked in groups I was ready to disappear, run away , do anything if only I were not here, cause i simply cant talk to people which i dont know, My palms and forehead began to sweat. When the homework was a pubic presentation or recitation of a verse by heart, I never completed these homewroks, as a result of which I got F grade and I had to hope only that in future we would no longer have such tasks, I was also afraid to go to the teacher and give me an individual task.",2,"outside, walk, run","A quick fact, in all my life I have never been to a cafe, to the cinema i wasnt even in a store alone.

You'd feel awful your entire life.nnSocial media is great, it brings people together, but you shouldn't put too much weight on it. It's almost always just a front, not the bigger picture. I've struggled with my fair share of self-esteem issues (and social anxiety) in the past, but the grass will always seem greener on the other side, there's always someone who's going to seem smarter, prettier, richer, more athletic, more friendly, but that's them and there's you. Try not to aim to be someone you wish to be, to be friends with people you want to be, that's almost always just a shallow idealization of you/them created in your mind. It isn't real.nnTry to also not control your college experience too much. I find that the deepest friendships form near your 3rd or 4th year, not during freshman orientation. Strike up a conversation when come_near appropriate, but don't control the situation. Friendship atomic_number_1 doesn't happen overnight, I know carnival it's hard to remember that when you no longer have your HS buddies around.nnTL;DR: I used to, but social media isn't a reflection of real life. Followers don't define your worth. Friendship takes time, but never force something you'd be miserable in."
