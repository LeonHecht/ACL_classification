It shouldn’t be used consistently for everyday relief of anxiety for these reasons but is good at its job and very effective for anxiety and can give people with debilitating anxiety some much needed relief from their symptoms Codeine - only tried a couple times a while ago (so i cant really give much information or experience) but i didn’t notice any problems with my anxiety while on it and outside talking to people , but its an opiate and not really meant for anxiety and can be very addictive and codeine specifically is very user dependent, as depending on your bodies metabolism, it releases an unknown amount of morphine (if interested I recommend you look into this, codeine even as a pain killer is pretty dangerous and hit or miss depending on your body).",0,outside,"don’t recommend it but thought should add it anyway Nicotine - helps little bit with anxiety and can give an excuse to leave a stressful situation or place and the habit of smoking could reduce anxiety nicotine could also make anxiety worse with and addiction, and is addictive and depending on method of ingestion - like has a slew with like cancer, etc. It has many like its extreme sedation, and memory loss and can make you like a zombie, and on note is very dangerous to mix alcohol a of reasons.

This friend here is a long story but basically I used to be tied to the hip with him until our adulthood when you start to ""live your own life"", he excelled while I couldn't move an inch because I guess I am me, I got so triggered I was about to flip and I deleted my Facebook!

"I'm also 18. Idk if this will help much...I had a job at Subway for literally 2 days, but found myself focused in the work and not really paying attention to what would normally bother me. I've heard people say to always keep focused on something to keep anxiety at bay but didn't truly realize it until then. I had to quit because the food repulsed me and I started taking harder college classes (while in highschool). Also didn't have a ride to get there lol.

"I am here for you if you need it, but first could you read this brain vomit first?. I try to be a good person. I will help people out whenever I can. I love being there for people and being able to make their day better. I have some inner turmoil over whether or not I am actually a good person or if I just delude myself into thinking I am. I get worried that I only help people to make me seem like a better person to myself, to justify thinking that I am one. I try to be fair and kind to everyone, but what if I am only fooling myself? I have met people in my life that just seemed so fake. Yes, they seemed nice, but you could see through it as an act, that they were just humoring the situation. I am scared I am one of these people except everyone but me can see who I really am. I am basically friendless. I have one good friend who has an SO and a kid with another on the way, and then couple people that I meet to have drinks with. I am a mess about this. I try my best to be a good person, but if I were one, wouldn't I have people that cared about me like I do them? Anyone I reach out to ignores me. I can't figure out why. Am I obnoxious? Am I so boring? Do I really contribute nothing worthwhile enough to have people want me around? I like to learn things. I like discussion. I like to share nice things I think about people. I will admit when I am wrong. I try to make everyone have an enjoyable time doing whatever we are doing. I have really bad anxiety. Sometimes this doesn't allow me to be myself, so I seem really shut off/ bored/or boring. But it is only sometimes, and to make it worse it usually happens when someone does finally get back in touch with me after I asked to hangout. I think, ""Oh man, they want to hangout? No one wants to hang out with me. If they do they will just end up regretting it since everyone else does. Or, if it goes well I will just ruin the friendship another time."" I have gotten better at hiding it, I think, though. I think I am fun. I like who I am. I am always open to bettering myself. I wish people could just be honest in what they think of me. I have seen someone distancing themselves from me (it is a common enough occurrence) and have intentionally pried into their reasons as to why, full well knowing it would be a faux pas, only to get transparent pleasantries and excuses. Which is reasonable if I put someone that is trying not to be close to me in a intimate spot. I didn't care that I was vulnerable. I just want to fix myself. I have never cared to be popular, or be in the spotlight. The small moments I have been, it is nice, but it is not something I seek at all. I just want people I meet/know to walk away thinking I was nice to talk to. That they had a good time sharing my company. It would be even nicer if I could have taught them something, or them pleased after I told them they taught me something. As much as I want those things, I cannot allow myself not to be me, though. I am very honest. I will not lie about anything, and the times I am forced to (socially, for some situation I cannot explain otherwise) you can see through the discomfort on my face. I have been called blunt, but I try to be tactful at all times. This leads to me brushing people the wrong way sometimes. But I cannot think of a time where the people upset by this trait were people I cared for. As I said, I will willingly admit that I am wrong. I think it is really important for people to admit that they are. You cannot know everything. Not being able to admit you don't makes you fail as a human. People I remember writing me off as an asshole are people that don't share this sentiment. For nearly a year I have been depressed about this. I broke up with one of the best people that has ever been in my life because I felt I wasn't good enough/just would keep her down. I lost a group of friends when I started dating her because my ex was the out-going hub of the entire friend group. So, me being around made my ex sad (I am not sure of better word) and the times both my gf and I went to a gathering it made my ex very uncomfortable. So I stopped getting invites to things.. then I stopped getting responses when I would try to plan something. This made me depressed, that either my friends didn't like me, or they liked someone who they know treats people poorly better than me because she was more fun. For a couple months after that I tried reaching out to people and no one cared to talk to me. At this point it was hurting my relationship with my gf. I started to feel bad that I couldn't be the person she fell for. I was too depressed to be me. And the days I felt like myself I still would get pangs of chest pain because I knew that she should have someone that society felt contributed. (She convinced me to quit my terrible job because she thought that was what was destroying me. Which, it was, but not all like she thought. This was also good advice from her point of view because I had a LOT in savings from doing nothing but working at this job. So leaving to find a job to better my happiness was a good thing to do.) I was jobless and friendless and the fact that she wanted me, as twisted and sick as it is, made me I stop loving her. She deserved someone better, so I made that choice for her. I wanted to be better. I wanted to be someone she deserved. So I started trying to be a person. I went and got a real hairstyle (I use to just use clippers and do it myself.) I started running/biking again. (I have chronic hip pain from my old job, so it made me lose my favorite thing to do.) I got over my anxiety of going to a gym and signed up for one. I went an bought a new wardrobe because she always dressed so nice and I just wore running/work out attire. I enrolled in school, which is something I stopped when I went full-time at my job that had mandatory over time 2-3 hours a day. In school I started strong, I was ahead of everything, getting close with my professors and the head of the department so I could get connections for an internship. Then my anxiety hit me, hard. I couldn't finish my resume because I am a 25 year old with nothing worthwhile to say on paper. I lost the internship prospects, hurt my relations with my professors. That caused depression, my grades started to slip towards the end of the semester. My 4 A's fell to near F's and I was lucky enough to find some willpower thanks to a nice classmate I knew from an old job and rounded my grades to C's before the end. Even though things went well for awhile, it didn't matter. Nothing changed. No one cared. I ended things last November with her. I was motivated to better myself until April. I went to the Gym every other day, I ate healthy, I wasn't excited to be back in school, but I did it and took pride in doing so. But the pride in myself diminished to nothing. I still had no one to go have fun with. No one texted how I was doing. I even stopped getting likes/conversations on Tinder, which was my last resort for a quick pick me up. I am lonelier more than ever, and I have been without close people most of my life. I use to get on cams to flirt/make fleeting friends before. Or teach people English (which is something that brought me joy.) Now the only connection I feel with people throughout the day are the 5 or so upvotes I get on something. I use to be a lurker and only send messages when I saw people hurting or if they seemed like they were remarkable genuine people for something they said. I would just tell them I would be here to listen for the former case and that I appreciate them if it were the latter. I use to get conversations from those, but now nothing. It is as if the world is intentionally turning its back on me. Since April I have basically laid in bed. I still go run/bike and work out at home, but it is a fight with myself to do that. I browse reddit, read books, masturbate, play league, or just lay in bed and scream in my head about what is wrong with me. I don't know if anyone knows how truly unhappy I am. I don't know if they know about my situation and feel awkward/helpless about it, so they ignore it, or if I am really fooling people. I don't want to be a burden so I don't talk about anything. When my brother's girlfriend asked why I wasn't leaving for classes I told her I missed the deadline to enroll because I was depressed a friend of mine passed away. Really though, we were no longer friends because she was part of that old group. I would have loved to be friends with her. She was one of the very few people that genuinely seemed to be happy to see me the entire year. I was especially torn up about losing someone that I use to call friend, and one that genuinely seemed to care about me (she cared about everyone. She was an amazing person) but even had that horrible thing not happened, I wouldn't have gotten out of my bed. Why couldn't the world have taken me instead? I can't find any strength in myself.

Sometimes this me to be myself, so I really shut off/ bored/or boring. is only sometimes, and it happens when someone does finally get back in touch with after I asked to I think, man, they want to No one wants to hang out with me. If they will just end up since everyone else does. Or, it goes well just ruin the friendship another time."" I have gotten better at hiding it, I think, though. think I am fun. I like who I am open to myself. I wish people could just be honest in think me. I have someone distancing themselves from me (it a common occurrence) and have intentionally pried into their reasons as to knowing it would a faux pas, only to get transparent pleasantries and excuses. is reasonable if I someone is trying not be close to me in a spot. I didn't care I vulnerable. I want to fix I have never to be popular, or be the spotlight. The small moments I been, it is is something I seek at all. I want people I meet/know to walk thinking I nice talk to. That they had a good sharing my company. It be even nicer if could have taught them or them pleased after told they me something. As much as I those things, I allow myself not to be me, though. I very I will lie about anything, and the times I am to (socially, for situation I cannot explain otherwise) you can through the on face. have been blunt, but try to be tactful at all times. This leads to me brushing wrong way But I think a time where the people upset by trait were people I cared for. As I said, I will willingly admit that I am wrong. I it is really people to admit that they are. You know Not able to admit you don't you fail as human. People I remember writing me off as an are that don't this sentiment. For nearly a year I have been depressed this. I broke one of best people has been in my life because I felt I wasn't enough/just would keep her I a group of friends when I started dating her because my was the out-going of the entire friend group. me being my ex sad (I am not of better word) the times both my gf and I went to a gathering it made ex very uncomfortable. So I stopped getting invites to things.. then stopped getting would try to plan something. This made depressed, that either my friends didn't like or they liked someone who they know treats people poorly better than me because she was more fun. a months after that I tried reaching people cared to talk to me. At this point it was my relationship with my gf. I started to feel bad that I couldn't be the person she fell I was too depressed to me. And the days I felt like myself I get of chest pain because I knew she that society felt contributed. (She convinced me to quit my terrible job because she that was what was destroying me. Which, was, all like thought. This was also good advice from her point of view because I had a LOT in from doing nothing but working this job. So leaving to find a happiness a thing to do.) I was jobless friendless the fact that she me, as and sick as it is, made me I loving She someone better, made choice for her. wanted to be better. I wanted to be she deserved. So started trying to a person. I went and got real hairstyle (I to just use clippers and it myself.) I running/biking again. (I have chronic hip pain from my old so made me lose my favorite to do.) I my anxiety of going a gym and signed up for one. went bought a new because she always dressed so nice I just wore running/work out attire. I enrolled in school, which is something I when I full-time job that over time hours a In school I started strong, was ahead getting my professors the of the department so I could get connections an internship. Then my anxiety hit me, hard. I couldn't my resume I am a 25 old with to say paper. I lost internship prospects, hurt my relations with my professors. That caused depression, my grades started to slip towards the end the semester. My A's fell to near F's I was enough to find some willpower to a nice classmate I knew from old job rounded my grades to C's the end. Even though things went well for awhile, it didn't matter. Nothing changed. No cared. I ended things last November with I was to better myself until April. I the Gym every other I ate healthy, wasn't excited to be back in school, but did it and took pride in doing so. pride in myself diminished nothing. I still had no to go have fun with. No texted I doing. even stopped likes/conversations on Tinder, my last for a quick pick me am lonelier than and I have been without close people most my life. I use to get on cams to flirt/make fleeting friends teach people (which something that brought me joy.) Now the only connection I feel with people throughout the day the 5 so upvotes I get on something. I use to be a and only when I saw people if they seemed like they were remarkable people for something they I would just them I would be here listen for the former case that I appreciate them it were the latter. use conversations from those, now is as if world is intentionally turning its back on me. Since have basically in I still go run/bike and work at home, it is a fight myself to do that. I browse read books, masturbate, play or just lay in bed and scream in head about what is wrong with me. I don't know if anyone how truly unhappy I am. I don't if they know about my situation and feel awkward/helpless it, they it, or if I am really people. don't want to be a so I don't talk about my brother's why I classes I her I the deadline to enroll because I a friend mine passed away. Really though, were no longer friends because she was part of that old group. would have loved to be friends with her. She was of the very few people that genuinely to be happy see the I was torn up about losing someone that I use call friend, and that genuinely seemed to care about me (she cared everyone. She was an amazing even had that horrible thing not I wouldn't have gotten out of my bed. Why the world have me instead? I can't find any strength myself. I don't know what to do."

It's just a mutual understanding between two people in a very basic sense.

"I've developed social anxiety since moving to a foreign country.. Back in my home country, I did not have this debilitating sense of dread whenever I needed to go outside. And I'm just there, probably they're oblivious to me even being there. Here's how my daily life feels like to me: I leave my apartment complex and walk to university. I have lived in Asia and went to an international school since the second grade. I refuse to acknowledge that I have a problem, and I keep looking for reasons as to why I might be the way I am now. I see people I've talked to before, but for some fucking reason I decide not to make eye contact and sit/lounge around alone. I take out my phone, hoping that nobody notices that I am a loner. I try not to make a fuss about it but I am actually panicking about where I would be able to sit down, without attracting attention to myself. I walk into the class, and am greeted by the sight and sound of hundreds of students in this massive lecture hall. I'm afraid of the eyes that aren't probably even looking in my direction, of the laughter I hear around me, thinking that it must be at my expense, while simultaneously knowing that it isn't. On my way, I feel that everybody is looking at me, judging me for being so awkward and lame. Once I get to the lecture rooms, people are conversing outside, talking to each other while waiting for class to start. Once lecture finishes, and classes are done for the day, I immediately walk back to my room. The worst part of all this is that I can't figure out why I am the way I am now. This walk back is often filled with bitterness and intense feeling of loneliness, as I pass by other students walking with their friends.

"To a degree, I think you're right. I'm someone who actually spent years self-isolating after dropping out of high school. Just stayed home all day, bedroom dwelling, stimulating my intellect by reading and surfing the internet - which can be very resourceful. I finally met with a psychiatrist earlier this year and am on Wellbutrin, which has done wonders for the social skills I already have, productivity, and confidence..so that's a plus. Still, though, there's times where I literally have to force myself out the front door, just to go check the mail. My dad had all of my bills sent to his house, instead, because I'd ""never go get them"". I'm also bad at breaking routines in the first place. I'm 28 at this time of writing, and still have never been in love or a real relationship. My parents never understood my mental illness and even just put me in an apartment when I was 21, and were done with it, criticizing and telling me to ""grow up"" and ""leave the nest"" along the way. I've never really mingled much. Friends like to barhop and socialize, I just sat around drinking a beer and scrolling through my Facebook news feed. Nevertheless, I'm the one who has had to jump over the social hump and eventually put myself out there. It's definitely not easy to find the motivation to do so, especially after you finally make some friends and get burnt by one that you thought was trustworthy. That kind of shit just pushes me back into my comfort zone, and the vicious cycle restarts itself. All I know is, I don't want to waste the rest of my youth being surrounded by the same four walls, and it's never too late to turn your life around.

"As someone who has suffered from social anxiety I recognise myself in your situation (and I think many other people does as well)nnMy first question to you is: Are you a gamer or do you have other similar time consuming hobbies? If you have I recommend you go cold turkey on it until graduation so that you can focus on preparing for the future as well as engaging in activities that will reduce your anxiety.nnThen I recommend that you try to spend at least half an hour each day (you can even use a timer) which you dedicate to deciding what you want to do for the future. Ask yourself what your dream job would be. Then do research about what you should be doing to to get closer to having that job. If having a university education improves your chances of fulfilling your dreams, then go for university. Once you have figured whether you want to study or immediately start working, it's time to take the necessary steps to achieve your goal. Research universities you want to apply for, research employers you want to work for. Then rank them according to how attractive they seem, this will significantly reduce anxiety, as even if you don't get your first option you will likely have dozens of good alternatives on your list. You said your grades were good, so someone is very likely to accept you. nnThen try to figure out what each institution/workplace requires from you. Start writing your CV, your letter of motivation or whatever else they might need. You still have until summer before you graduate, and if you spend half an hour per day on these things the time will add up.nnRegarding your social anxiety there are many techniques you can use to reduce or remove it completely, but it does require some work. A good first step is always to ask yourself what gives you the most anxiety. Is it public speaking? Is it conversations? Based on your story it sounds like you have anxiety about meeting new people (a fear I know all too well). The best solution to this is, of course, to keep meeting new people. Find out about social activities you can do in your town or neighbourhood is there a sports-club, movie-club, hiking group, debating society? Another advice is to build a social anxiety ladder, where you will rank your anxieties from least to most anxiety provoking. Then work yourself up this list. Start by exposing yourself to situation that only makes your slightly anxious, once you feel that you can handle these more easily, start on the next item on the list.nnAlso, I need to add that just because you feel anxious around the people in your class doesn't mean that you will feel anxious around other people in the future. You said it was fine before you started gymnasium, so it is not unlikely that some anxiety are caused by the type of people you hang out with. Personally I don't interact with most people from my course unless I have to. Most of my friends are from other courses, or from outside of university altogether.

"All these plans will be in my calendar by Thursday. And I know I would be annoyed by someone hogging all the conversation space too. But it feels like there is this motor running in me, like if I don't let my friends know my each and every thought that they will forget about me or I will fall apart. It'll be like Friday night drinks and dancing, Saturday brunch, park hangout, and then party at night, Sunday brunch and shopping with another friend and hopefully leaving the night open to deal with the Sunday Scaries. They'll bring up the amount of people I wave to on the street while I'm with them, but what they don't understand is that while I have those people to wave to, those friendships are shallow and limited to just waving at each other or exchanging smalltalk whenever we run into each other. They're not fulfilling relationships. Thus, I recently realized these (along with other things) probably lead me to living with high-functioning ADHD, and may explain why I have been so freaking anxious my whole life.

"Medication advice for social anxiety.... Hi all,nnI'm 25 years old and been struggling with social anxiety for most of my teenage and adult life. For the last couple of years, I have been trying to deal with it independently through herbal supplements like L-theanine and Valerian Root, but still find myself overwhelmed with anxiety in most social situations to the point where I ""black out"" - people tell me that I'm talking coherently and sound cool, calm, and collected, but when I think back on that situation, I can't remember how I spoke, what my audience's attention level was, or even most of what I said. nnThis blackout mental state applies to social parties where I dont know many people, times of conflict between friends and coworkers, and any sort of public speaking capacity. I'm a wildlife biologist and have some meetings coming up of statewide importance where I'll be presenting several proposed regulatory changes to hunting regulations. Obviously, I cant afford to risk my social anxiety affecting my performance and reputation at these public meetings. Moreover, in my anxiety overridden mind, I dont have the mental clarity to convey facts and what's germane to the conversation well and am always kicking myself post-presentation for important points I meant to say but didn't.nnSo, I'm finally throwing in the towel on thinking I can ""beat"" my social anxiety and am going to pursue some kind of anxiety medication to help me. I hate to admit it, but I need help. I'm a little freaked out by medications for mental illnesses - my twin sister has been on them for several years and I dont even recognize her anymore. nnAny folks out there with social anxiety that can share their experiences with different medications and what worked and didnt work for them, side effects, etc?

Sometimes it can be outside forces working against sufferers, especially when sufferers are trying. There are also a large number of people who are easily lead into believing negative stereotypes and make real judgements on people rather than engaging with them.

"Why am I so gullible?. Even though I generally believe most people are assholes, I still seem to always fall for people's tricks and to trust people I shouldn't. I think I'm overly nice to everyone (even people I dislike) since I'm so lonely and I have no friends. An example of me being really gullible happened today. At work, I signed up for secret santa and got a girl, Ashley, who's kind of annoying, but who never really seemed sneaky or bitchy to me. She had previously asked me who my secret santa was, and of course I had to tell her I wasn't going to tell anyone, since it was her. So i figured she knew it was me. Well last week, Ashley told me she was thinking about getting the girl she got, Brenda, an Anastasia Beverly Hills glow kit for her gift. Ashley asked me for my opinion and asked if she thought Brenda would like it. Now, these glow kits are like $42 and the spending limit for secret santa was $15! I told Ashley it was a good gift, but that it was really expensive. Ashley just said ""I know."" Well, stupid me then felt like I should spend more than $15 on Ashley since she was spending so much on Brenda. I figured Ashley might have been telling me this just so I would get her a better gift, but I thought she would actually get Brenda the glow kit, since Ashley seems to consider Brenda to be a work friend. So, of course I bought Ashley stuff from PINK and spent $30 on her gift. Well today, Brenda opened her gift today at work in front of me and big surprise, it wasn't a glow kit. It was a $10 giftcard and a pair of socks. So Ashley didn't go $1 over the $15 limit. I know it's my fault for not keeping within the limit, but I feel so naiive and gullible! I also feel lame because I feel like Ashley probably told some of our other coworkers her plan and they probably laughed about how stupid I am. How do I become less gullible? and why do people seem to always take advantage of my kindness?

"Every now and then people would walk by, getting in and out of cars, and every time I would look down at my phone and pretend like I was texting someone so I wouldn't look like some creepy dude just sitting in a mall parking lot at night. Finally I said fuck it and just went in to a regular showing which was 45 minutes later. Got done with work super early and hadn't seen Rogue One yet because I'd been putting it off because I had no one to go see it with and was anxious about going to the theater alone, but last night I finally went. I couldn't tell if I was actually crying or if it was just rain dripping down from my head, and even though I haven't really felt suicidal since November, I felt this strange desire to let go of the steering wheel and just crash, or go park somewhere and walk for a long time through the rain and go lie down on the ground somewhere by myself and fall asleep and never wake up; suddenly I just had this sense that this was the night, this was it, this was the time to finally do it. I ended up just returning home and getting slightly drunk before going to bed, and now everything is back to normal. I just drove around until I got there; I knew I would find it eventually but the entire time I felt somehow lost. I was planning on going to an 8:30 IMAX 3D showing but once I'd finally parked in the lot outside the mall I got so nervous that I couldn't bring myself to get out and I ended up just sitting there in my car for an hour. It wasn't relief that I was alone, it wasn't sadness that I was alone, it was some new, dreamlike emotion I don't think I've ever felt before; in that moment suddenly it became so perfectly clear that I didn't have to be afraid of any of it, none of this world had to be against me if I didn't want it to, and if I wanted to, I could do anything, because I was free to do so. One of the most surreal experiences I've ever had was walking toward the exit to get out of this place that normally causes me so much anxiety, this place called a ""mall"" that is the epitome of fears associated with SA, this place that is usually bustling with crowds of people going every which way--and it was just me. When I got to the row of glass doors I stopped and turned around and just stood there for about 10 seconds just taking in my surroundings, gazing down the hallway still brightly illuminated by the lineup of shops with this soft orange-golden glow, the sound of a vacuum cleaner somewhere, and the ever so audible patter of southern California rain outside against the concrete out there in the dark.",0,"outside, walk, park","Every now and then people walk by, getting in of cars, and every time I phone and pretend like was texting someone so wouldn't look like some creepy dude just sitting in a mall parking lot at night.

"I GOT TO RIDE IN A TESLA. AGH IM SUPER PROUD OF MYSELF FOR THIS My sister(20F), her friend(20M), and I (16F) went riding around our state just enjoying being out of the house. I joked around and said “One of us should just go up and say ‘hey I like your car’” my sister took that as a chance to annoy me and started teasing me saying I should do it and that I would never. I knocked on the window and said “hey my friends and I thought u had a really cool car and I also think you’re really cute and cool so uh yeah” (I get word vomit when trying to initiate a conversation which I rarely do). I mean I still to this day can’t order food for myself I tell my family what I want and they do it for me so the fact that I went up to her and then got to ride in a freaking TESLA is so so big for me!! It was just like sitting next to a fire! It was super cool and since I was the one who went up to her I got to ride in the front seat which I NEVER get to do because of my sisters friends and stuff. Turns out the lady actually WORKED for Tesla so she offered all three of us a little joy ride up and down the mountain, we even got to see some really cool stuff like how they have a “romance” setting where it shows a fireplace on the screen and the AC suddenly turns to heat as ur seat starts to warm up. We said we wouldn’t tell our parents (partly because we went from 0-60 MPH in 3 seconds and one simple turn of the wheel we would’ve literally fallen off of the mountain) but honestly this is such a big accomplishment for me!

"Selfish: Not selfish enough, if you're worried about what people think ehrn you go to study. Being selfish isn't even an inherently bad thing - its important to take care of yourself and do what you need to do to make sure your needs and goals are met. Sometimes that will involve putting people lower on your priority list, and inconveniencing them.nnInsecure: A lot of people are. It can be really tough being comfortable with yourself, especially while you're still going through school. That doesn't directly mean that you're flawed, or that you're broken. By the sounds of it, things are unstable at home, and that would cause someone to learn to be more withdrawn and on the defensive. That's you adapting and learning, and trying to keep yourself from getting hurt. Opening up to people and environments takes time. Its risky, and can be stressful and that's ok. You're already making steps to overcome that by sharing here, and that took guts.nnJealous: I'd imagine this would be you looking at people who are successful, or people who are more extroverted and are able to socialize without the same hurdles that you have. It's ok. Those people, regardless of how well it looks like they're handling things, are also going through rough things of their own. It's just different varying levels of fake-it-till-you-make-it. Friend of mine at work had decided to take on a whole client and become their go-to person and learn all their systems. She was doing great, and she's really knowledgeable and an expert at what she does. She had to step down from that position a month later. Turns out she was in panic the whole time, having to juggle a lot of work, and on the verge of breaking down because it was too much at once. She seemed fine on the outside though. People want to put out a Best Self. Just know it isn't always how they feel on the inside.nnDependent: i dont have as much context for this one, but I'll run with what I understand. It sounds like things are difficult to do on your own with the troubles happening from home, and from your anxiety. You need to lean on others to keep that in check, and so you won't have to face social situations on your own. It also gives you a chance to be with someone that seems to not be having the same trouble you are, so its a bit of escapism as well. This is not entirely a bad thing. Better to be dependant and alive, rather than try to cut your connections and possibly end up in a worse condition. Independene is good, and necessary to learn, but learning to reach out to people and opening up to them is also a skill that you'll need to practice over time. Humans are by nature social creatures that rely on each other a lot. People lean on each other, and that's ok. If it helps your perspective, I'm still with my parents, still learning to drive (22), and kinda rely on feedback from my coworkers to be abke to believe I'm doing a good job.nnThe above points are mostly objective reasonings to counteract the impulse thoughts. The thoughts come in vague, like ""you're not good enough"". But because they're vague, they have weak points. They aren't true statements. You can respond back with an answer, so that your mind will start to reaffirm your answer instead of repeating the thought. ""yeah, maybe I'm not good enough for some things, but I'm not worthless. I've made a lot of progress. I've struggled a lot. I'm still alive and still trying, and I'm gonna get to that point where I am good enough. I'm already making progress there.

"How would I even go about getting help.. I really have been enjoying reading things in this community. Sorry for the long post. Anyway I am 22 years old living at home. I have had this for as long as I can remember. As a kid I was always told it was shyness and I would grow out of it. I waited forever and it never did. Perhaps it didnt because I was the #1 target to bully in school. (Middle/high) principles and teachers bullied me to death. I have stated in different post on how my mom deals with general anxiety and somewhat understands but my dad has been complete opposite. He thinks I should be out working. I am in college (business administration because idk what else), online only of course, it allows me to do work and not hear what teachers think of it. Originally my dad promised to not harass me for a job until after college. That changed fast. I dont guess it's necessary to talk about my jobs but you can skip this if you want to. I have maybe got a year worth of work in altogether. Walmart xmas seasonal, started as a cashier and practically begged to be a buggy pusher instead. Little did I know this didnt stop interaction.

"A quick fact, in all my life I have never been to a cafe, to the cinema i wasnt even in a store alone. And there is no way out for me. As far as I remember myself, I was always a rather shy and closed child, I did not go out outside unnecessarily. I had to move from countryside to city (not to far tho, about 130 kms) and learn to live on my own, buy groceries, pay utility bills and most importantly communicate with people, from that moment I no longer saw my friends live, both moved to other cities.
