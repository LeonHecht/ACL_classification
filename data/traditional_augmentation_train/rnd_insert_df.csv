"I wouldn's say I've overcome it completely yet but I do feel much better now compared to how I was a year ago where I barely left my house all by myself. I like to think of these things like challenges/experiments. For example, if you're afraid of walking around the streets by yourself, start off by walking around the neighbourhood where you still feel slightly anxious, but a lot safer, and continue doing that until you feel like there's no threat anymore then go for bigger things, if you've got phone anxiety then dial strangers on purpose and act stupid then say you've got the wrong number and hang up. If wanna talk freely to a group of around 6 people for example, try expressing yourself when there's only 2 people for example. You know, baby steps. I also tried to neutralize my anxious thoughts. If an anxious thought would suddenly occur about an upcoming event, I would try to calm myself down and say something like ""Maybe, it won't be as bad as I think, maybe I'll do better this time, it can't be that bad."", ""I've done this before and I know I'll do it again, I certainly won't die!"" Mantras such as ""I am completely independent of the good and bad opinions of the others"" in my opinion also help. ""Haters gonna hate"", ""I can only be myself, and if someone doesn't like me finger for it, then it's their problem, not mine"". use ""I am just as important as anyone else is."", etc.. Sometimes if I fail and end up being awkward or ane anxious I just try to pick myself up, dust myself off and congratulate myself for at least trying, telling myself that maybe next time I'll do better because I know that as long as I keep trying and moving on, and some day when that last restriction of my life melts away, I will finally reach my goal where I'll be happy, anxiety free and live the life I've always wanted.

"I have social anxiety and it makes me super uncomfortable when my little sister’s boyfriend and her sleep in the same bed in the room next to me.. I (20F) have social anxiety, I have no friends, let nighttime alone had a boyfriend and my sister (17) has everything I never had. In February she started dating this guy (17 also) and he lives like an hour away from my house (I moved back in with my parents, brother and sister from university when this covid thing happened). Because he lives kind of far away, he sleeps here for a couple of nights and then my sister sleeps there for a couple of nights too. Usually, my sister slept on the couch and he would sleep in her room and in the morning she would go back in her room. The firsts couple of times he slept over, I would hear her awaken in the middle of the night get up and go to her room (my parents didn’t know she was doing that) and when doing that, she would wake me by walking past my room and I had a hard time falling back asleep. That happened about five times before I decided to talk to her about it. When I was talking to her, I felt like she was scared that I would tell our parents, which I didn’t, but she asked my mom to talk to me about it because she didn’t understand what was waking me up. She told our mom that I was probably waking up at midnight when she would go from her room to the couch. Because she decided to go to our mom about that, I told her (our mom) that it was at 3 or 4 in the morning and sometimes I couldn’t even fall back asleep. So after my mom had all the information, I guess she talked to my sister because for like a month after that she would always stay on the couch until at least 8 in the morning. But the last time he was here, they slept in her bed all night, together, for the two nights he was here. I don’t think my parents know. I know she’s 17 and her boyfriend is really sweet, but it makes me soooo uncomfortable. I even had trouble sleeping at night during those two nights because I knew they were sleeping in the same bed, in the room next to me. Today, I went into her room to get something (I had her permission) and I saw that she started taking birth control. That made me even more uncomfortable. I just kept replaying the sounds I heard in the middle of the night like the bed moving and things like that as making up scenarios... So what I want to know is: should I tell my mom that it makes me uncomfortable when they sleep in the same bed? I don’t know if my mom and my sister talked and my mom told her it was ok for them to sleep in the same bed and I don’t want to make things awkward. Honestly, I don’t think I would have talk to my mom about it if my sister hadn’t talk to her in the first place.. The main reason it makes me uncomfortable is because I never had a boyfriend and I always thought I should be an example for my siblings because I am the oldest, but clearly I failed at that because my sister has her life way more figured out than me. What should I do? What would you do if it made you that uncomfortable?",0,walk

One of the most surreal experiences I've ever had was walking toward the exit to get out of this place that normally causes me so much anxiety, this place called a ""mall"" that is the epitome of fears associated with SA, this place that is usually bustling with crowds of people going every which way--and it was just me.

"I'm near your age and have had two jobs thus far. My social anxiety is very crippling, but I realize I need money to make my life better in the long run (i.e college funds, rent, etc). So here are some personal tips: nn1. Volunteer. Local pet shelters are great for this as they accept everyone who is willing and not a crazy psycho trying to skin cats. This will introduce you to the antiophthalmic_factor social environment of work, and if you volunteer at a pet shelter you will have animals to calm you during the stressful moments. Plus you can literally decide to go whenever you want. For me I go once a week for an hour or two and I even lead shifts now. It helps.nn2. Apply for quiet places. Like a fabrics store or garden center. Something very mello will help your anxiety. My first job was at Walmart in the produce section. The worst you'll have to deal with is someone asking you where the oranges are while standing in front of them. You don't have to work at McDonald's boo, you can be a recluse and water plants for 6 hours a day.nn3. You have phone anxiety like me, so don't pick up! behave Let them leave a voicemail. I got so many calls when applying for my first jobs and never once answered the first time. They would leave a voicemail and I would promptly call back within 2 hours to a day and give some believable excuse as to why I couldn't answer such as I was in school, on the road, personal issue, bad cell service, etc. They'd always be happy to hear back and I would schedule interviews that way. Once you multitude have an interview, save their number and wait for a call back and pick up if you can that time.nn4. Practice practice practice! Write down possible questions and answers to them. Go over them outloud. Take phone calls in a quiet or calm place. Practice common interview questions and prepare to be nervous.nn5. Set your hours low at first and work later or in the mornings. Go for about 18 to 20 a week and work from there. Do NOT, I REPEAT, DON'T set hours you'll hate out of desperation that they will only want you if your availability is from 8am to 10pm Monday to Sunday. Also, pick late or early shifts. I.e pick shifts after people go to work for the day to before they get off (9am to 3pm) or after they are usually at home or asleep (9pm to early am for me personally). This is a great time to work at a store like Walmart, Target, etc. The most customers you'll face are nurses or old women who are looking for plants in the meat asile. Get to know your city's schedule and schedule yourself for times when the mass of people are typically busy or elsewhere. 24 hour stores are usually in need of people for these shifts.nn6. Finally, tell them you have anxiety. I have had two jobs, but have been offered over five and have applied to about 15 places. All of which, if I was interviewed, I explained my social anxiety. Employers nowadays are a bit more sensitive to this. You can say ""I have very bad social anxiety, and would prefer doing things mostly in the back or away from people until I am used to the work environment to prevent any problems from arising."" They'll usually say ""well we will train you to do x thing, but if it takes some time we'll work with you."" That's when you know they're interested. Don't hide your anxiety to someone who can affect your future employability. My current boss and assistant manager both know how bad I suffer and often coddle me when they see it affecting my work performance. My fellow employees, though I am not friends with them, also understand this and will help me. I work in a pizza place and I take orders on register, give out food, and answer phones. When I need to step away I ask someone to take over and they will. Getting overwhelmed isn't bad, just take a second to step back.nnSome other general tips to remember: Always apply for jobs you'll like FIRST, wait a few days, and then apply for jobs you can deal with theoretically. Try to really go for jobs that match your interests as it'll be easier to adjust to.nnIf you get denied, don't freak. I did this before and it does nothing but take away all your hard work. An interview will happen again.nnI hope I helped.",1,Garden

"As someone who has suffered from social anxiety I recognise myself in your situation (and I think many other people does as well)nnMy first question to you is: Are you a gamer or do you have other similar time consuming hobbies? If you have I recommend you go cold turkey on it until graduation so that you can focus on preparing for the future as well as engaging in activities that will reduce your anxiety.nnThen I recommend that you try to spend at least half an hour each day (you can even use a timer) which you dedicate to deciding what you want to do for the future. Ask yourself what your dream job would be. Then do research about what you should be doing to to get closer to having that job. If having a university education improves your chances of fulfilling your dreams, then go for university. Once you have figured whether you want to study or immediately start working, it's time to take the necessary steps to achieve your goal. Research universities you want to apply for, research employers you want to work for. Then rank them according to how attractive they seem, this will significantly reduce anxiety, as even if you don't get your first option you will likely have dozens of good alternatives on your list. You said your grades were good, so someone is very likely to accept you. nnThen try to figure out what each institution/workplace requires from you. Start writing your CV, your letter of motivation or whatever else they might need. You still have until summer before you graduate, and if you spend half an hour per day on these things the time will add up.nnRegarding your social anxiety there are many techniques you can use to reduce or remove it completely, but it does require some work. A good first step is always to ask yourself what gives you the most anxiety. Is it public speaking? Is it conversations? Based on your story it improving sounds like you have anxiety about meeting new people (a fear I know all too well). The best solution to this is, of course, to keep meeting new people. Find out about social activities you can do in your town or neighbourhood is there a sports-club, movie-club, hiking group, debating society? Another advice is to build a social anxiety ladder, where you will rank your anxieties from least to most anxiety provoking. Then work yourself up this list. Start by exposing yourself to accomplish situation that only makes your slightly anxious, once you feel that you can handle these more easily, start on the next item on the list.nnAlso, I need to add that just because you feel anxious around the people in your class doesn't mean that you will feel anxious around other straight_off people in the future. You said it was fine before you started gymnasium, so it is not unlikely that some anxiety are caused by the type of people you hang out with. Personally I don't interact with most people from my course unless I have to. Most of my friends are from other courses, or from outside of university altogether. Everyone has certain types of people that they feel more comfortable around, eventually you will find your type :)nnGood luck! Hope it helped a little bit.",1,Hiking

"I don’t recommend it but thought I should add it anyway Nicotine - helps a little bit with anxiety and stress, and can give you an excuse to leave a stressful situation or place and the habit of smoking could reduce anxiety but nicotine could also make anxiety worse with cravings and addiction, and is really addictive and depending on method of ingestion - like cigs - has a whole slew of bad effects with it like heart disease, cancer, etc. It has many negatives like its addictiveness, extreme sedation, and memory loss and can make you like a zombie, and on a side note is very dangerous to mix with alcohol for a number of reasons. It shouldn’t be used consistently for everyday relief of anxiety for these reasons but is good at its job and very effective for anxiety and can give people with debilitating anxiety some much needed relief from their symptoms Codeine - only tried a couple times a while ago (so i cant really give much information or experience) but i didn’t notice any problems with my anxiety while on it and outside talking to people , unity but its an opiate and not really meant for anxiety and can be very addictive and codeine specifically is very user dependent, as depending on your bodies metabolism, it the_great_unwashed releases an unknown amount of morphine (if interested I recommend you look into this, codeine even as a pain killer practically is pretty dangerous and hit or miss depending on your body).",0,outside

Anyway, I called the police and they picked me up in a van and we drove around the neighbourhood trying to find them but couldn't so they drove me home. I almost fell over and at first I was so shocked that I didn't say anything as they walked away (just walked, didn't even try to run) and my anxiety kicked in and I thought ""just don't say anything"" but then about 10 seconds pass and I decided to shout at them.

"it sounds like you’re mostly into just tasting it tho, and you didn’t say it runs in your family, so i honestly think you’d be fine to test it out and see how things go. one tip i’d say is to just space fly_the_coop out your drinking bc you can build a IT tolerance for it, which would require that you drink more to achieve the same feeling and that can get bad if you get alcohol poisoning.",0,runs
"But the problem is I also have a very severe Fear of Missing Out and the idea that all of them will be having fun at the pool without me really makes me feel very anxious and almost sick. I just find it really weird and couldn't deal with it. It's warm here so my friends are planning to go to the swimming pool in town together to cool off. Now the bad part is, my parents have some Ativan in their drawers, and when they go, I feel like I have no choice but to take it, iodin because for the entire time that my friends are there I will not be able to be calm without it (even with it it will be bad). So, I don't even know if anyone is going to read extinct this but here it goes. The problem uncanny is as obviously I'm writing here I have social anxiety and I really don't want my friends to see my shirtless/etc.",3,"swimming, pool"
I got super dark 5% car window tint today by accident. I i along recently got a new (used) car and it had absolutely no tint and I really hate being exposed to the sun and being stared at along by dudes so I decided to get tint on my windows. In my state you are allowed to have as low as 35% tint and that is what miserable I was planning to get.,0,sun
Why do random people take out their insecurities on me?. I was outside on my break and some lady walks past me saying “there are some bad vibes here and I don’t like knocked_out insecurity it”. Wtf?,0,"outside, walk"
"A quick walk to the kitchen before I leave (there are other tenants I avoid), back to my dorm room. Computer game before I get self-conscious and anxious. I feel like I'm too passive to do 1 anything now. I just realized I've been home with very minor walks to a store outside for 4 weeks. I took a ace break this semester due to... Well, mental illness I guess. Social isolation for the 4th week and I'm forgetting time.",2,"walk, outside"
"If anyone should know when you're being yourself, it's yourself. In a year there is no way you would know eachother inside out. There's a possibility your SO has created an idea of what he thinks you would be like in his head, or man perhaps your more atomic_number_2 introverted and reserved nature might make him think you're holding back, but honestly human beings have so many different elements to their personality.",0,nature

I just wish that I could just relax the_like and look as normal and comfortable as everyone else because this shit makes me feel and look like an old man with back problems at the age of 16. Like earlier today in gym my teacher made us play a game of basketball and during the game my movements were just so weird and robotic especially when I was handed the ball and had to dribble down the court. Social anxiety makes me so stiff it’s like my muscles just can’t relax because I’m always so formula tense and anxious all the time.,0,basketball
