I had to move from countryside to city (not to far tho, about 130 kms) and learn to live on my own, buy groceries, pay utility bills and most importantly communicate with people, from that moment I no longer saw my friends live, both moved to other cities. In high school, the situation did not change, I was still afraid of public speaking and did not leave home unnecessarily, and when friends called for a walk, I always said that I was busy. My first friends (and the only ones) appeared in my 5th grade. No kidding, when I reached the bus stop and went to the university, for me it was a real challenge. Speaking of future at the university, each English class needed to stand in front of the audience and tell the learned text, there were also quite often group work, and if I could barely cope with the first example, then when we worked in groups I was ready to disappear, run away , do anything if only I were not here, cause i simply cant talk to people which i dont know, My palms and forehead began to sweat. When the homework was a pubic presentation or recitation of a verse by heart, I never completed these homewroks, as a result of which I got F grade and I had to hope only that in classes we would no longer have such tasks, I was also afraid to go to the teacher and give me an individual task.",2,"outside, walk, run"

But if I decide to wait, then I just look silly because maybe I could've made it, and in their heads they're all like ""...why didn't that weird guy cross the street lol."" If the walking signal is on that's good and in most cases no problem, but the worst is when you only have like 10 seconds left to cross so I'm not sure if I should start crossing since I might not make it in time.

"I wouldn's say I've overcome it completely yet but I do feel much better now compared to how I was a year ago where I barely left my house all by myself. I like myself think of these things like challenges/experiments. For example, if you're afraid of walking around the streets by yourself, start off by walking around the neighbourhood where you still feel slightly anxious, but a lot safer, and continue doing that until you feel like there's no threat anymore then go for bigger things, if you've got phone anxiety then dial strangers on purpose and act stupid then say you've got the wrong number and hang up. If wanna talk freely to a group of around 6 people for example, try expressing yourself when there's only 2 people for example. You know, baby steps. I also tried to neutralize my anxious thoughts. If an anxious thought would suddenly occur about an upcoming event, I would try to calm myself down and say something like ""Maybe, it won't be as bad as I think, maybe I'll do better this time, it can't be that bad."", ""I've done this before and I know I'll do it again, I certainly won't die!"" Mantras such as ""I am completely independent of the good and bad opinions of the others"" in my opinion also help. ""Haters gonna hate"", ""I can only be myself, and if someone doesn't like me for it, then it's their problem, not mine"". ""I am just as important as anyone else is."", etc.. Sometimes if I fail and end up being awkward or anxious I just try to pick myself up, dust myself off and congratulate to for at least trying, telling myself that maybe next time I'll do better because I know that as long as I keep trying and moving on, and some day when that last restriction of my life melts away, I will finally reach my goal where I'll be happy, anxiety free and live the life I've always wanted.

"I have social anxiety and it makes me super uncomfortable when my little sister’s boyfriend and her sleep in the same bed in the room next to me.. I (20F) have social anxiety, I have no friends, let alone had a boyfriend and my sister (17) has everything I never had. In February she started dating this guy (17 also) and he lives like an parents, away from my house (I moved back in with my hour brother and sister from university when this covid thing happened). Because he lives kind of far away, he sleeps here for a couple of nights and then my sister sleeps there for a couple of nights too. Usually, my sister slept on the couch and he would sleep in her room and in the morning she would go back in her room. The firsts couple of times he slept over, I would hear her in the middle of the night get up and go to her room (my parents didn’t know she was doing that) and when doing that, she would wake me by walking past my room and I had a hard time falling back asleep. That happened about five times before I decided to talk to her about it. When I was talking to her, I felt like she was scared that I would tell our parents, which I didn’t, but she asked my mom to talk to me about it because she didn’t understand what was waking me up. She told our mom that I was probably waking up at midnight when she would go from her room to the couch. Because she decided to go to our mom about that, I told her (our mom) that it was at 3 or 4 in the morning and sometimes I couldn’t even fall back asleep. So after my mom had all the information, I guess she talked to my sister because for like a month after that she would always stay on the couch until at least 8 in the morning. But the last time he was here, they slept in her bed all night, together, for the two nights he was here. I don’t think my parents know. I know she’s 17 and her boyfriend is really sweet, but it makes me soooo uncomfortable. I even had trouble sleeping at night during those two nights because I knew they were sleeping in the same bed, in the room next to me. Today, I went into her room to get something (I had her permission) and I saw that she started taking birth control. That made me even more uncomfortable. I just kept replaying the sounds I heard in the middle of the night like the bed moving and things like that as making up scenarios... So what I want to know is: should I tell my mom that it makes me uncomfortable when they sleep in the same bed? I don’t know if my mom and my sister talked and my mom told her it was ok for them to sleep in the same bed and I don’t want to make things awkward. Honestly, I don’t think I would have talk to my mom about it if my sister hadn’t talk to her in the first place.. The main reason it makes me uncomfortable is because I never had a boyfriend and I always thought I should be an example for my siblings because I am the oldest, but clearly I failed at that because my sister has her life way more figured out than me. What should I do? What would you do if it made you that uncomfortable?",0,walk

"Every now and then people would walk by, getting in and out of cars, and every time I would look down at my phone and pretend like I was texting someone so I wouldn't look like some creepy dude just sitting in a mall parking lot at night. Finally I said fuck it and just went in to a regular showing which was 45 minutes later. Got done with work super early and hadn't seen Rogue One yet because I'd been putting it off because I had no one to go see it with and was anxious about going to the theater alone, but last night I finally went. I couldn't tell if I was actually crying or if it was just rain dripping down from my head, and even though I haven't really felt suicidal since November, I felt this strange desire to let go of the steering wheel and just crash, or go park somewhere and walk for a long time through the rain and go lie down on the ground somewhere by myself and fall asleep and never wake up; suddenly I I had this sense that this was the night, this was it, this was the time to finally do it. I ended up just returning home and getting slightly drunk before going to bed, and now everything is back to normal. I just drove around until just got there; I knew I would find it eventually but the entire time I felt somehow lost. I was planning on going to an 8:30 IMAX 3D showing but once I'd finally parked in the lot outside the mall I got so nervous that I couldn't bring myself to get out and I ended up just sitting there in my car for an hour. It wasn't relief that I was alone, it wasn't sadness that I was alone, it was some new, dreamlike emotion I don't think I've ever felt before; in that moment suddenly it became so perfectly clear that I didn't have to be afraid of any of it, none of this world had to be against me if I didn't want it to, and if I wanted to, I could do anything, because I was free to do so. One of the most surreal experiences I've ever had was walking toward the exit to get out of this place that normally causes me so much anxiety, this place called a ""mall"" that is the epitome of fears associated with SA, this place that is usually bustling with crowds of people going every which way--and it was just me. When I got to the row of glass doors I stopped and turned around and just stood there for about 10 seconds just taking in my surroundings, gazing down the hallway still brightly illuminated by the lineup of shops with this soft orange-golden glow, the sound of a vacuum cleaner somewhere, and the ever so audible patter of southern California rain outside against the concrete out there in the dark.",0,"outside, walk, park"

Sometimes in my head I feel like I am being a creep by looking and smiling at them when i walk by, but I need to get rid of that mindset. When walking down the street, for example, lately I've been trying to walk with my head up, make eye contact and smile at (most) females who walk by me - although sometimes they'll sometimes look at me then look away real quick, or just look at me and look down. etc.",1,"walk, outside"
"How do I leave a room full of talking coworkers?. I work in an office, and where I am, everyone is near each other on their computers doing work. At the end of the day (around 5:30) they all get up, and start socializing. I don't because I don't really know anyone THAT well, and I wouldn't have much to talk about anyway. My brother let me know he was ready to leave (he got ready the job and works in a different part of the building) so I got up to go. Everyone was talking so I pretended to look at my phone and act as if I got a text from him that he was me to leave. I made eye contact with one of the people I know, and said I was leaving, but my voice was probably drowned out by everyone talking. So I just walked out after standing there uncomfortably for 20 seconds. Everyone is so nice to me, so I don't want anyone to think I'm being rude by walking out. I don't know how to leave properly. Do I interrupt people while they're talking to tell them I'm leaving? I don't have the voice to just go ""I'm leaving everyone!"". I'm so quiet that most people wouldn't notice anyway.

And the things you could do is spend time in the area but not entirely walk through the main gate. Best of luck using the main gate and I hope if it’s somewhat difficult for you that you allow yourself to familiarize yourself with the area and hopefully own up to it and give your anxiety a good run for it! I don’t know if this is something that you struggle with as well but I’m hoping it could help either way for yourself to lead somewhat of a easier time and actually using the main gate like any other student would that has a bunch of their own things to care about. Seems to me that you need to own up to your anxiety in hopes of cutting down on the time spent getting to class. Try to spend time as the close vicinity of the main gate and just watch in everyone else has to go through there to get to class like they should as it’s the best way to get to class right?,0,"walk, run"

"I'm near your age and have had two jobs thus far. My social anxiety is very crippling, but I realize I need money to make my life better in the long run (i.e college funds, rent, etc). So here are some personal tips: nn1. Volunteer. Local pet shelters are great for this as they accept everyone who is willing and not a crazy psycho trying to skin cats. This will introduce you to the social environment of work, and if you volunteer at a pet shelter you will have animals to calm you during the stressful moments. Plus you can literally decide to go whenever you want. For me I go once a week for an hour or two and I even lead shifts now. It helps.nn2. Apply for quiet places. Like a fabrics store or garden center. Something very mello will help your anxiety. My first job was at Walmart in the produce section. The worst you'll have to deal with is someone asking you where the oranges are while standing in front of them. You don't have to work at McDonald's boo, you can be a recluse and water plants for 6 hours a day.nn3. You have phone anxiety like me, so don't pick up! Let them leave a voicemail. I got so many calls when applying for my first jobs and never once answered the first time. They would leave a voicemail and I would promptly call back within 2 hours to a day and give some believable excuse as to why I couldn't answer such as I was in school, on the road, personal issue, bad cell service, etc. They'd always be happy to hear back and I would schedule interviews that way. Once you have an interview, save their number and wait for a call back and pick up if you can that time.nn4. Practice practice practice! Write down possible questions and answers to them. Go over them outloud. Take phone calls in a quiet or calm place. Practice common interview questions and prepare to be nervous.nn5. Set your hours low at first and work later or in the mornings. Go for about 18 to 20 a week and work from there. Do NOT, I REPEAT, DON'T set hours you'll hate out of desperation that they will only want you if your availability is from 8am to 10pm Monday to Sunday. Also, pick late or early shifts. I.e pick shifts after people go to work for the day to before they get off (9am to 3pm) or after they are usually at home or asleep (9pm to early am for me personally). This is a great time to work at a store like Walmart, Target, etc. The most customers you'll face are nurses or old women who are looking for plants in the meat asile. Get to know your city's schedule and schedule yourself for times when the mass of people are typically busy or elsewhere. 24 hour stores are usually in need of people for these shifts.nn6. Finally, tell them you have anxiety. I have had two jobs, but have been offered over five and have applied to about 15 places. All of which, if I was interviewed, I explained my social anxiety. Employers nowadays are a bit more sensitive to this. You can say ""I have very bad social anxiety, and would prefer doing things mostly in the back or away from people until I am used to the work environment to prevent any problems from arising."" They'll usually say ""well we will train you to do x thing, but if it takes some time we'll work with you."" That's when you know they're interested. Don't hide your anxiety to someone who can affect your future employability. My current boss and friends manager both know how bad I suffer and often coddle me when they see it affecting my work performance. My fellow employees, though I am not assistant with them, also understand this and will help me. I work in a pizza place and I take orders on register, give out food, and answer phones. When I need to step away I ask someone to take over and they will. Getting overwhelmed isn't bad, just take a second to step back.nnSome other general tips to remember: Always apply for jobs you'll like FIRST, wait a few days, and then apply for jobs you can deal with theoretically. Try to really go for jobs that match your interests as it'll be easier to adjust to.nnIf you get denied, don't freak. I did this before and it does nothing but take away all your hard work. An interview will happen again.nnI hope I helped.",1,Garden

And I'm just there, probably they're oblivious to me even being there. Here's how my daily life feels like to me: I leave my apartment complex and walk to university. I have lived in Asia and went to an international school since the second grade. I refuse to acknowledge that I have a problem, and I keep looking for reasons as to why I might be the way I am now. I see people I've talked to before, but for some fucking reason I decide not to make eye contact and sit/lounge around alone. I take out my phone, hoping that nobody notices that I am a loner. I try not to make a fuss about it but I am actually panicking about for I would be able to sit down, without attracting attention to myself. I walk into the class, and am greeted by the sight and sound of hundreds of students in this massive lecture hall. I'm afraid of the eyes that aren't probably even looking in my direction, of the laughter I hear around me, thinking that it must be at my expense, while simultaneously knowing that it isn't. On my way, I feel that everybody is looking at me, judging me for being so awkward and lame. Once I get to the lecture rooms, people are conversing outside, talking to each other while waiting for class to start. Once lecture finishes, and classes are done where the day, I immediately walk back to my room. The worst part of all this is that I can't figure out why I am the way I am now.

"As someone who has suffered from social anxiety I recognise myself in your situation (and I think many other people does as well)nnMy first question to you is: Are you a gamer or do you have other similar time consuming hobbies? If you have I recommend you go cold turkey on it until graduation so that you can focus on preparing for the future as well as engaging in activities that will reduce your anxiety.nnThen I recommend that you try to spend at least half an hour each day (you can even use a timer) which you rank to deciding what you want to do for the future. Ask yourself what your dream job would be. Then do research about what you should be doing to to get closer to having that job. If having a university education improves your chances of fulfilling your dreams, then go for university. Once you have figured whether you want to study or immediately start working, it's time to take the necessary steps to achieve your goal. Research universities you want to apply for, research employers you want to work for. Then dedicate them according to how attractive they seem, this will significantly reduce anxiety, as even if you don't get your first option you will likely have dozens of good alternatives on your list. You said your grades were good, so someone is very likely to accept you. nnThen try to figure out what each institution/workplace requires from you. Start writing your CV, your letter of motivation or whatever else they might need. You still have until summer before you graduate, and if you spend half an hour per day on these things the time will add up.nnRegarding your social anxiety there are many techniques you can use to reduce or remove it completely, but it does require some work. A good first step is always to ask yourself what gives you the most anxiety. Is it public speaking? Is it conversations? Based on your story it sounds like you have anxiety about meeting new people (a fear I know all too well). The best solution to this is, of course, to keep meeting new people. Find out about social activities you can do in your town or neighbourhood is there a sports-club, movie-club, hiking group, debating society? Another advice is to build a social anxiety ladder, where you will rank your anxieties from least to most anxiety provoking. Then work yourself up this list. Start by exposing yourself to situation that only makes your slightly anxious, once you feel that you can handle these more easily, start on the next item on the list.nnAlso, I need to add that just because you feel anxious around the people in your class doesn't mean that you will feel anxious around other people in the future. You said it was fine before you started gymnasium, so it is not unlikely that some anxiety are caused by the type of people you hang out with. Personally I don't interact with most people from my course unless I have to. Most of my friends are from other courses, or from outside of university altogether. Everyone has certain types of people that they feel more comfortable around, eventually you will find your type :)nnGood luck! Hope it helped a little bit.",1,Hiking

It is nothing fancy, but I was always going straight back home after lectures to study so I was very rarely interacting with anyone (even if it is just eye contact) and on some days where I had no lectures, I’d be home all day on my computer.

"I don’t recommend it but thought I should add it anyway Nicotine - helps a little bit with anxiety and stress, and can give you an excuse to leave a stressful situation or place and the habit of smoking could reduce anxiety but nicotine could also make anxiety worse with cravings and addiction, and is really addictive and depending on method of ingestion - like can - has a whole slew of bad effects with it like heart disease, cancer, etc. It has many negatives like its addictiveness, extreme sedation, and memory loss and can make you like a zombie, and on a side note is very dangerous to mix with alcohol for a number of reasons. It shouldn’t be used consistently for everyday relief of anxiety for these reasons but is good at its job and very effective for anxiety and can give people with debilitating anxiety some much needed relief from their symptoms Codeine - only tried a couple times a while ago (so i cant really give much information or experience) but i didn’t notice any problems with my anxiety while on it and outside talking to people , but its an opiate and not really meant for anxiety and cigs be very addictive and codeine specifically is very user dependent, as depending on your bodies metabolism, it releases an unknown amount of morphine (if interested I recommend you look into this, codeine even as a pain killer is pretty dangerous and hit or miss depending on your body).",0,outside

Apparently the girls caught wind of what I had asked and pulled me outside of one of our other clubs and started yelling at me for why I did that saying they felt hurt I went behind their backs (honestly tho to just a question I don’t see what’s wrong with it) it was a 2 on 1 situation which didn’t help so I said “can we handle this at the club you guys know I struggle with social situations and this isn’t putting me in the best mindframe right now” (that’s my go to statement for when I’m about to have a panic attack and need to get out of a situation) they said that what I did was bugging them and was selfish so they weren’t letting me go, my thoughts were all jumbled so I was just trying to leave and tell them all I did was ask a question. Finally I just ran away despite them trying to get me back and ended up having one of the worst panic attacks I had that year (this was a year ago). So I don’t like confrontation but I wanted it’s step out of my comfort zone because I’m really passionate about a club I’m in so I wanted to be president (huge step but I was willing to take it) these girls were telling me I couldn’t run because they were going to be president and there wasn’t going to be a vote so I asked our advisor.

I felt isolated and people around me perceived me the same way. I still had no friends at European school, I haven't had any walks which I had constantly with my friends back in Ukraine. I was weak and skinny and didn't know how to protect myself. It looked like the kids where either going out the way I didn't understand or the didn't do it at all.
