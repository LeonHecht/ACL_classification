"I'm near your and have had two jobs thus far. My social anxiety is very crippling, but I need money to make life better in the long run college funds, rent, So here some personal tips: nn1. Volunteer. pet shelters great for this as they accept everyone who willing and not crazy trying skin cats. This will to social environment of and if at a pet shelter you have animals you during stressful moments. Plus you can literally to go whenever you want. For me I week for an or two and I even now. It helps.nn2. Apply for places. Like a fabrics store or garden center. very mello help your anxiety. My was at Walmart in produce section. The worst you'll have deal with is asking you the oranges standing in front of them. don't have work McDonald's boo, you be a recluse and water plants for 6 a day.nn3. You have anxiety like so don't pick up! Let leave voicemail. I got so many when applying my first jobs and never once answered the first time. They would leave a voicemail and I would promptly back within hours a day and give some believable excuse as to why couldn't such as was in school, on the road, personal issue, bad cell service, etc. They'd always to hear would schedule interviews that way. Once you have an interview, their number and wait a call up if can time.nn4. Practice practice practice! Write down possible questions and answers to them. Go over them outloud. Take phone calls in quiet or calm place. common questions and prepare to nervous.nn5. Set your hours low at first and work later in the Go 18 to 20 a week and work from Do NOT, I REPEAT, DON'T you'll hate out of desperation they will you your availability 8am to 10pm Monday to Sunday. Also, pick late or early I.e pick shifts after go to for the to before they get off (9am to 3pm) or after they are usually at home asleep (9pm to early am for me This is a great time work at a store like Walmart, Target, etc. you'll nurses or old women who are looking for in the meat asile. Get know your city's schedule and schedule yourself for times when mass of people are typically busy or 24 hour stores are usually in need of people for these shifts.nn6. Finally, tell them you have anxiety. I have two jobs, but have been over five and have applied 15 places. All of which, I was interviewed, I social anxiety. Employers a bit more sensitive to this. You can ""I have very bad anxiety, and would prefer doing things mostly in back or away from people until I am used work environment to any problems from arising."" They'll usually say ""well we will train you to do x but it takes some time we'll work with you."" That's when they're interested. hide your anxiety someone can affect your future employability. My manager both know how bad I and often coddle when they see it affecting work My fellow employees, though I am not with also understand this and will help me. I work in a pizza place I take orders on register, give answer phones. When step away I ask someone to take over and they will. overwhelmed isn't bad, just take a second to step back.nnSome other tips to remember: for jobs you'll like FIRST, wait a few and then apply for jobs can deal with theoretically. to really go for jobs that match your interests as it'll be easier adjust you denied, don't freak. I did this before it does nothing but take all your hard work. interview again.nnI hope I helped.",1,Garden
