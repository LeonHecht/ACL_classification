"Outside I feel like I’m dying. Hi friends. I hope you’re all doing very well. I just want to make a little dispossessed, as my support system is the worst and literally nobody gets it. But I know that you guys always make me feel better and I’m really grateful for that, basically I’m in this summer camp for a month. Yes, a month of hell to learn a language and I can’t go out and go. I signed up because months ago my sa wasn’t so bad. So I thought why I’m not here instead of enjoying this camp. I’m dealing with anxiety and depression. It’s only been a week and everyone has made friends of their group. And let me say that I met some great people and became their friend in the first few days.",3
Jogging if you're looking for the light you'll find it if you're looking for the dark is all you're going to see in my first semester of college I've tried a lot to overcome my sa while I ended up making progress it wasn't as fast as I had hoped and I still had a lot of problems doing some things like jogging in public I ended up getting quite depressed and the next two semesters were quite failures as I lost my motivation I was finally able to get back on my feet again in part because I was forced to interact with some people in a project group it's not something that you can quickly overcome it's something that you have to overcome step by step and inch and there will be setbacks but that it's okay to focus on the little wins like really going to a club instead of the little failures not being able to talk,3

social anxiety on the way to recovery social anxiety is a terrible mental health disorder having suffered from it as I was I understand how debilitating it can be just going out and how fear before just making it the simplest of tasks can make it feel like I am doing this post because although I know that this subreddit tends to be mainly memes and jokes and I love that we all share a common thing that we all suffer from social anxiety and for many this post will be useless but when I first subscribe to this subreddit id never did anything significant to address and deal with my mental health I had a feeling of hopelessness that I no longer have and if I could come back in time and give these words to myself I would like to have the self-control to make your health easier than I have met a girl in the last year that I have faced with going to college but I need a future that she needs to get a better social education than better than I would have people of social education and what you have more difficult than education than what you have more difficult than what you have to do than you have to do than make education more difficult to do education and education and education.,3
"On foot, running makes someone get paranoid with more than one car driving behind you. I just got my student permit in May at age. I’ve been slowly pushing myself. First I started driving literally down the block and back on a quiet side street. My second time I drove on a longer but still quiet side street and back third time I drove in the evening around pm with my mom and went to the roads with street lights. But I stayed close to my house. Fourth time at the time of the afternoon. I drove by myself and drove further than before. I drove a few times after that. But I want to get to my main point, as with most of you. I hate large groups of people when I see someone walking behind me on the same side of the street.",3
