"walk, park, tree, run i was just assaulted by a gang of teens so i was walking in the park and i saw a gang of about teens maybe years old or so im always aware of everyone because of my anxiety so i did have thoughts about how maybe they would do something to me but i have that thought every time i see a gang of young people im only myself so i dismissed it like i always do i just walked past them a bit nervous but overall calm and not expecting anything to happen out of nowhere some kid slams into me from behind i actually thought a tree branch had fallen on me or something at first i was facing the other way so i didnt really see what he did but it was like he slammed his whole body into me or something just totally unprovoked i pretty much blend in theres literally nothing about my appearance or demeanour that would offend or piss someone off but they apparently decided i was a good target i almost fell over and at first i was so shocked that i didnt say anything as they walked away just walked didnt even try to run and my anxiety kicked in and i thought just dont say anything but then about seconds pass and i decided to shout at them the time elapsed probably gave off signals that im not very assertive plus my anxiety was probably evident so they just laughed at me and ran off i continued walking feeling pretty shit about myself i sat down in my usual spot and i tried to relax but i couldnt i felt really anxious and shaky im a pretty sensitive guy anyway but this is something ive never experienced before and i kept playing over in my head how lame i sounded when i shouted at them and i actually felt like crying while i was sitting under a tree feeling terrible and trying not to cry in public i saw them come back over to me and one of them threw a rock at me it didnt hit me but it freaked me out then before i could say anything they started throwing rocks at windows trying to break them seeing them again actually made me feel calm my anxiety lifted i was really nervous about passing them again to leave the park but then when i saw them i realised they were just a bunch of idiot kids and i felt alright anyway i called the police and they picked me up in a van and we drove around the neighbourhood trying to find them but couldnt so they drove me home i was hoping wed catch them because even though that would mean i would have had to face them again i kind of wanted them to realise i wasnt some push over who just allows kids to assault me i wanted to talk to them again and teach them a lesson but overall it worked out fine so im happy about that i tried my best and i feel good now as opposed to anxious and shaky i see lots of people asking here if you can overcome social anxiety and im not sure if you can get rid of it completely maybe but i do know that it can be massively improved i used to be agoraphobic i was afraid to leave the house because of the people id have to encounter now i can leave the house and do things that i never thought id be able to do years ago i couldnt even pick up a telephone and now i can deal with highstress situations like this without completely breaking down i definitely could have handled it better but i did my best and hopefully stuff like this will make me more socially hardy its totally possible to improve guys",2

"walk, camps sharing my experience of social anxiety for the first time hi before i begin talking about my social anxiety i would just like to say that this is not my usual account i created this because i feel that it would hinder my ability to properly express myself if i use my personal account sorry if this infringes on any of the rules i am not totally familiar with them you can take this down if you want or let me know and i will fixtake it down for you im years old male and i believe that i have some form of social anxiety and i want to share how it has so far affected my life i recently started university in the uk and i am in a flat of other people my earliest memory and i believe one of the causes of my social anxiety was christmas day when i was about or my uncle came to our house for the first time he lived in another country and he brought a camcorder he filmed us opening our presents and i was so excited i always wanted to be on camera and see myself on the tv when i heard my voice on the tv aged i wanted it turned off immediately i try never to speak on camera even now i have usually found it really really hard to make new friends if i make one i latch on to him as much as possible and usually divert any conversations to them if someone i know tries to initiate a conversation with me im currently at weeks into university and i havent made any friends which is my fault because i dont initiate any conversations and any conversations that i do have last around seconds because i dont know what to say to people its usually goes hi insert name here other person hi insert name here me how are you other person good you me im good other person thats good me awkward pause and i walk off to avoid further embarrassment i promised myself that on the first day i moved in i would introduce myself to everyone but when i walked in they said hi and i got really hot and flustered and couldnt i rarely leave my room only to go to lectures and seminars which i worry about hours beforehand and i often go days without eating proper food because people are currently in the kitchen at school it was a little bit of a benefit because while people would take time in their work to talk i would out of awkwardness concentrate fully on my work now at university they suggest that you join or form a study group with your friends which is hard because im on the other side of the country and i have no friends here i am really worried how i will communicate with others when we have to start giving group presentations and working in groups we havent even been assigned one yet and it already takes up hours of worry in my mind i am worried because i want to be successful at whatever it is that i am doing but i cant properly talk to people and i know that this will be a huge hindrance i have never approached someone of the opposite gender and talked to them i dont know what to say i only have one friend who is a girl and its more a friendship of association because she is my friends girlfriends one of the feelings that i get when i am around people is a feeling of inferiority i am foot which is small for a male and have always been the smallest in my class i have been mistaken for up to years younger than i am and i think this is one of the causes of it i cant just talk to someone for the sake of it i have to have a reason otherwise i would be wasting their time if someone else initiates a conversation with one of my friends or vice versa i stand there really really awkwardly i cant wait in queues with a whole bunch of people because i feel like i am holding them up if i am waiting to go into a lecture i wait towards the back of the group because i dont want to add to their displeasure of waiting its almost as if subconsciously that my presence offends people not that i think that i am in any way important quite opposite i feel like a nobody if there was anything important that i needed to ask someone about that i didnt know from school i would do it on facebook and even then it would take a few hours to come up with what i saw as the right way to frame this even for this post i have to keep reminding myself that it is anonymous my parents dont know how seriously it affects me they think im shy and often when i was younger they would get cross because i wouldnt socially interact with other people for summer camps for example anyway the purpose of this post was to share my experience with social anxiety and at least get a little bit of the pressure off my chest having not talked so freely in my entire life it feels that i have had a little bit of word vomit i tried to make this post as coherent as possible thanks for taking the time to read this",2
walk im in the exact same situation i havent done anything since i left school and i practically never leave the house unless its for a short walk every couple of months i started applying for jobs recently as much as the thought terrifies me i have an interview for mcdonalds on the th of jan as if the interview isnt bad enough for someone with social anxiety i have to do some kind of on job evaluation where the manager watches you work there for something like mins and just carry out tasks everyone else does like interacting with customers honestly im dreading it,2

soccer people dont understand people dont understand that interacting with people is the closest thing to impossible for me im years old i take anti depressants that dont do anything i cant answer the door my phone is always muted so i wont hear phone calls i barely leave the house to avoid people i dont have a job when people come to our house i close myself in my room when a bank or something calls me on my phone i either dont pickup or i let someone else talk for me when i need to go to the doctor or something someone comes with me im intimidated by people worried about getting hurt i get anxiety attacks if im surrounded by people i will just collapse if someone talks to me its probably our of pety or because they want something i was bullied in school so many times in elementary school i was called to play soccer and instead got beat up so yes i dont interact and i will be so quiet youll forget im even there so dont ask me why and dont try making me talk that doesnt do any good just makes everything worse,2
outside ive had a nearly identical experience all the way up to the being affectionate with someone else part it hurts she was my childhood friend since kindergarten she was practically giving me all the signals shed sit on the ground outside with me during lunch all the damn time especially when i was alone one of her friends asked me if i liked her which i gave an incredibly oblivious and vague answer to because i didnt catch on at the time and this one we briefly yet meaningfully held hands we were in the high schools whos who section in the yearbook as the shyest boygirl or years in a row and took a cool picture that we dressed up for together but i didnt really press it any further i tried to will myself to make a move any move but i was too scared my subconscious held me back so she moved on got a boyfriend of her own i dont think shes with him anymore but i still havent seen her since high school i dont know if ill ever see her again so rage against your subconscious thoughts telling you to be quiet because its worth taking that chance of rejection if i saw her again id tell her how i felt about her back then,2
outside are we brothers haha similar stuff happened to me i just tried to be independent starting with the smallest details like moving outside alone or going to the doctor alone and just doing the stuff she always helped me with on my own im still trying though and i wish i had learnt all this at a younger age,2
hiking hiking going out in the woods,2
bike i have had one panic attack it was when i was supposed to start working for a person years ago and i had to go there on my bike about minutes before i had to go i started feeling like i was going to die but i wasnt overly nervous about going its like my body was heavily stressed out about something that my mind was just a little stressed out about i dont get why that happens i came upstairs and told my mom and she informed me that i was having a panic attack and i talked to her for the next minutes before i left in order to distract from the feeling that i was going to die,2
park anxiety hits when i want to get intimate or communicate my feelings with someone i am and have never held a real relationship or had sex because i get in my head that they wont like me will reject me or laugh at me when i was i got my first girlfriend and she broke up with me after dating for a few months because i really never took the relationship past going on dates and we kissed like twice after me and my girlfriend broke up i decided to do something about it and i started seeing this girl after we ended up hooking up a few times at some parties and i asked her out but then she said she didnt want to see me again since then i have gone on like one or two dates since then one went well enough that the girl invited me back to her place after some drinks but when i got there i freaked out thinking that she wasnt going to like me and while we were watching netflix on her bed i fell asleep i was embarrassed and didnt ask her out again and after that i didnt go out with someone for about a year i transferred colleges back closer to home and started hanging out with one of my old friends little sister since we both went to the same school i eventually got feelings for her and when i told her she said she was seeing this guy she was hooking up with i got super down and felt like she didnt like me at all but we still hung out all the time last summer also after getting rejected by i decided to lose a bunch of weight dropping from down to pounds bc i felt self conscious about my weight while her and this guy she was seeing werent officially dating we still hung out a bunch one on one she would come over to drink and then one night i got up enough courage to ask if she wanted to stay the night and she said yes at this moment i should have thought that she liked me and wanted to be with me but i kept thinking about that time she rejected me i also kept thinking about how to make a move but i would just get super freaked out about the whole thing because i wasnt sure how to make a move without bringing up my feelings yet again i was in bed with a girl i liked but could not do anything about it because the first two relationships i was in ended with my rejection by them she then started to see that guy and they started to date each other but in february they broke up for a nd time we started to hang out more after they broke up and weeks ago we started to go out once or twice a week we went to a bar and then went to a park later that week about a week ago i got an invite to come over to her place and we would drink some wine and watched some netflix in her room she then asked me if i wanted to stay the night and i freaked out again and decided to go back to my place since then i have tried to see her again and now she is always busy and i feel as though i fucked something up just because i overthink things i started seeing a therapist once a month since december and i feel that shes been helping a lot with my personal life outside of relationships but i havent really discussed anything about my love life with her because i feel embarrassed i am wondering if there is anyone who has experienced something similar and how they went about to change their mindset,2
outside not sure if i have social anxiety or something else as a kid i was pretty social i had an best friend we played all the time and i spoke to some other people too i was a little shy sometimes at the age of in my new class which included my best friend i was very distant with the others i wasnt really interested in making friends i thought this would happen automatically like when i was litte hehe it wasnt the case i never talked in class i just talked with my best friend at the time but now we are pretty distant then i slowly began to feel lonely and making new friends wasnt an option im always uncomfortable and nervous when i talk to strangers and i know that i have like really low conversation skills i avoid it because i know i will fail i began to sleep less at night i wanted to gain some extra hours to enjoy my day because school is far from enjoyable i always take hour naps after school because its very exhausting to sit there for hours straight and being bored after the naps i still feel tired and depressed the only time i feel like being alive is at the weekend or vacation i am in peace when i dont have to go outside and talk with anybody i feel like i put myself in a cage and there is no way to let my true personality see the daylight okay i think i just answered my own question idk have i do you guys feel the same this is a lot of personal info i never really talk about my feelings its feels good to write it down thought i probably made some mistakes in my orthograph sorry for my english,2
"garden, outside i literally cannot talk to another person i will try and keep a very very long story as short as possible so here goes i have never been social having only a few friends my entire life ive always had bad social anxiety a few years ago my father died i was a university student at the time and just locked myself in my room living nocturnally and only operating when everyone else was asleep i would go months without talking to anyone and ended up failing university and dropping out so i moved back home with my mother and have lived as a complete shutin for almost two years i literally do not leave the house i will sometimes go in the garden but no further there is no need now i am just incomprehensibly socially anxious i cannot answer the door to the mailman when he delivers parcels or even talk to people on the phone i realised how bad this was and had to ask my mother to book me an appointment at the therapist which she did so i prepared to leave the house to go to one session and when we arrived i could not talk to him i uttered my name and said hello and then just started crying i just couldnt think of anything to say so i just ran outside and back to the car im a year old man this is pathetic what do i do please",2
"walk, outside had a panic attack at new years party so for the first time in years i went to a new years eve party it was my boyfriends coworkers party and i was invited to go i brought alcohol with me in hopes that it would make me more relaxed and confident to talk to people and for a while i was fine after midnight i was starting to get very drunk and sleepy the other people who were there were all chatting and having a good time i continued to drink and didnt realize how much ive had until i was barely able to walk i stuck by my boyfriends side and he kept conversing with other people while i was starting to fade in and out of consciousness i eventually found myself on the couch by myself and someone was telling me to play a game with them i started to panic and didnt know what to do my boyfriend went to the table where they were going to start playing the game and looked over at me and asked if i was going to play and i just agreed because i didnt want to be left out the first game was fine it was a pictionary type game then the next game dealt with reading out cards and doing whatever was on the card i was starting to feel my pulse rising and i couldnt think or control my body every now and then theyd make jokes and id quietly laugh and one of the girls looked at me and said you know you can just laugh you dont have to hide it or cover your mouth and at that moment i became hyperaware of all of my actionsi didnt realize i was trying to hide my laughter and her pointing that out just sent me into a major state of panici just kinda stopped myself from reacting to anything because i didnt know what to do eventually it got to my turn in the game and i asked if i could just pass it to the next person because i was feeling extremely anxious at this point but they insisted i just read the card i tried reading the card but they couldnt really understand me so my boyfriend had to take the card and read it i felt embarrassed and just sat there feeling really anxious i felt so out of place in that moment and i just wanted to escape i snuck away from the table and sat on the couch by myself and started hyperventilating i texted my boyfriend if i could leave because im having a panic attack a few minutes pass and he tells me to go outside but i didnt want them to see me walk outside or question meso i just sat there and started crying a few more minutes pass and my boyfriend came over to me and asked me if i wanted to go outside with him and we did i was judging myself so hard and i felt so upset at myself for taking my boyfriend away from the party but he tried his best to take care of me we stayed the night at the friends house and i was up most of the night feeling really sick its the next day and i apologized to my boyfriends coworker telling her i had a bit of a panic attack she was understanding i just keep thinking about everything that happened and how my brain blew everything way out of proportion to the point i couldnt control my actions or thoughts i feel so bad that my boyfriend is so social and likes to be around friends but im the super quiet girlfriend thats afraid of socializing he keeps telling me its fine and everything is good and that he loves me and wants to protect me and it makes me happybut i just feel bad for having such a bad reactioni just drank way too much thinking id be a social butterfly but it did quite the opposite ugh",2

"walk, outside youre not a pretender i used to think that a lot too because in some aspects im doing good or am not any more anxious than an average person but i have my weak sides which show i have sad just on monday i went to language courses to a place i had never been to and i was constantly feeling my heart beating and going bpm starting two hours before the lesson was about to start i had to walk back and forth in my room and all i could do was worry now that is not normal i get like this before any social events too however its easy to forget because over the years ive organized my life so that in my day to day life i dont encounter that highanxiety inducing situations i can go to uni fine i can have a presentation in front of a small group anxious but not too much i can talk to people at work i can go outside on the street without feeling anxious only sometimes i do so im betting if they say you had sad at the hospital then you must have had it if your current psychologist does not agree ask why and correct her if shes wrong about something about you be ready to see why you dont have it any moreor explain why you think you have it etc and if it doesnt seem right to you you can always make an appointment with some other psychologist",2
parkour dont say never you dont have a girlfriend now so what does that mean youll never get one no your present does not determine your future as you have the power to make the decisions to change your future into a more desirable one i understand this can sound harsh but op i needed it when i felt the same way as you so hear me out by the way the size of your dick doesnt matter as some girls cant comfortably take a lot anyway sex is not a requisite for social status dont let society fool you a relationship will not be healthy in the long term if you are emotionally vulnerable take the time to grow and take care of yourself first worry for yourself before other things please stop smoking and drinking alcohol find an alternative even vaping or whatever when you try a certain way and it doesnt work try another way alcohol is a depressant smoking shits on your health dont consume them take up classes dance martial arts parkour cooking anything help the community out volunteer the meetup app has clubs you can join to meet people of similar interests the best way to rid yourself of social anxiety is through exposure you can learn social skills you have so much potential op you just have to keep your head up despite the challenges it will not be easy and dont let yourself stop you from progressing our biggest demons are not the adversities around us but ourselves keep a realistic mindset and you can get to what you want be wary of absolute thinking patterns you can do it whenever you get depressive be your own cheerleader and remind yourself of what you can achieve you are never weak due to mental illness having mental illness is hardcore and you are so strong for wrangling it if you need further support hit me up ill be happy to help you in any way i can source i have social anxiety and depression and it has gotten a lot better,2

outside social anxiety from eating in public advice on selfhelp tips for overcoming this sorry in advance for the long story that im about to post but i hope you guys give it a read ive been getting social anxiety especially from eating in public for years now and the fact that i cant even have a peacefulenjoyable meal out with my friends have been eating me inside out and i want to overcome this so so so badly the past few years has honestly been the worst few years of my life and i so desperately want things to change the eating anxiety i have doesnt really come from being afraid of being looked at in public its more of being afraid that i would gagthrow up when eating because of the intense nauseous feelings i get whenever i am eating outside in public and it simply just kills my appetite its like a vicious cycle this is how it all started years ago i was still all fine with very minimal social anxiety since young i have always been a shy and quiet person if you dont get to know me well but among my friends id like to think that i am quite talkative and fun i hung out with friends very easily in school and used to enjoy going out with them i even had many friends from the popular group in school if thats what you call them however sadly this changed for the worse in i was finishing school and was about to enter mandatory military service i suddenly got so much anxiety ever since i was about to enter military as there was so much uncertainties that i had about it i was afraid that i would have a tough time afraid that i would not be able to adapt to a very different environment afraid of missing home too much etc to put it shortly there were so many things that were not under my control that gave me so much anxiety during this period i was still at school when all these anxiety came about and it seemed to just keep getting worse during that time sometimes in the morning before going to school id feel nauseous for no reason even brushing my teeth in the morning would cause me to gag sometimes even though rarely i would even have to go to the toilet just because i felt like throwing up from the nausea i was getting i started losing appetite very easily and started to rarely have a proper meal during lunch time in school i started avoiding going out with my friends because of all this feelings i was getting stemming from the anxiety i got fast forward to now i have completed my service and about to start uni early next year i would say that my anxiety has gotten much better compared to where i was a few years back however i was never the same in terms of eating in public ever since i still get all nauseouschoked upno appetite whenever i am eating outside when i eat at home its the complete opposite i can properly enjoy a good meal with no issues at all when im home because i feel safe that even if i throw upgag nobody can notice or judge and because of this sense of safety ironically i dont have any anxiety at all and dont feel any nausea however when im out i can only eat in small bites and i find it so difficult to even finish a normal meal its taken such a massive toll on my social life in the past i would hang out with my friends every week and also go outside to play sports every week now these things rarely ever happen anymore not because i wasnt invited but because i had to reject my friends every time they asked me out because i didnt want to end up embarassing myself when we have a meal honestly this really hurt me so much because my friends probably now thinks i am deliberately avoiding them or that i dont wanna hang out with them anymore but the truth is i really dont have a choice because of all the anxiety i have had experienced sometimes i just wished that everyone can understand how i feel or what i am going through i am starting school again in a few months and i really want to just change myself and go back to my old self where i had no anxiety when eating in public where i could really feel joy and happiness when going out with my family and friends where i dont have to keep worrying about my eating anxiety and where i can just feel genuinely happy again please advice me on tips i can use as selfhelp to overcome my social eating anxiety and thank you for taking the time off your day to read my story,2

"outside, park always getting pumped up through my stupid fucking imagination at home to end up feeling worse than beforesocial anxietydepression and almost pointless happiness i do meditation im m i end up feeling like i can be who i want through meditation after i do it in the morning for about minutes with meditation music but every time i go out with someone i end up just feeling like shit again because im afraid to talk about certain stuff it only really seems to help me temporarily and if im at home doing it for some reason i have tried it outside before but being around other people basically just counteracts it because of anxiety to talk i always ending up wishing i just forcesaid what i wanted to because then i would be confident and then none of this shit would be happening there have even been times ive been so anxious before that it basically made me suicidal because i couldnt even tackle a fear that only exists in my fucking head this is basically the definition of just being afraid of fear itself without any real context to it i was able to feel happy just through meditation and positivity easier than this it didnt mean i wasnt fucking anxious though even though a couple of months ago when i was doing that i thought it was normal to be anxious when it wasnt i thought meditating in fucking college toilets and the local park back then with a laptopphone and meditation music would help but it didnt happiness does not fix much tbh when you stop feeling it for a while then you finally realise all the things that are wrong with youit did make me feel better at the time lol maybe its not pointless even if im not perfect from feeling it i do hope i can still somewhat challenge it by going to social eventslike they always say to go to in the future even if there will always be some things im scared to talk about i still do dream of being crazily confident in the future even if its completely frivolous to do just on its own yet somewhat inspiring even being motivated feels pointless now because what exactly is it im going to do with it anyway i wish there was like a week program i could go on where people just force me to have to talk and shit dont know about any of those yet though i also posted this to rmeditation if you want the link its here",2
"running, walk, park my most recent experience im making a mess out of this recent situation i have going on so i got in an university about a week and a half ago my classes started this past week and i still didnt go a single day last monday i just felt like i didnt want to but in reality i was just running away like i always do tuesday i left my house with the intent of going but about midway through i just started panicking and instead walked around the city so my family didnt start suspecting of anything i swear i never walked as much a i did that day it was pathetic and all because im afraid to go to class that was when i decided that i wouldnt go at all that week and instead id prepare myself and today id be in a changed man an all the fear and anxiety would be gone late night sunday the same disgusting feeling started going on again heart racing this awful feeling on my stomach where you are completely comfortable on your couch yet it feels like something isnt right i go to youtube and start watching the same guys again and again trying to get this awful feeling out of my body trying to find some sort of miraculous solution for my problems today i wake up leave my house to go to school but each stride makes me more and more anxious i create all these movies inside my head how will they react will i be accepted what should i say will they talk to me what i they ask me a question so like last week i just didnt go again instead im typing this in the sort of park while listening to music this same thing happened to me last year too i spent about a week going to university and turning back last moment without entering the actual school room because i was afraid of what id find out the worst part is that im breaking the trust of my family who thinks im being an adult and being responsible im years old im studying in my city what am i afraid of i dont get it i know that once i eventually break this cycle ill look back and think i had nothing to be scared of like i said the same happened to me last year and after going things went pretty smoothly i know taking action is the most difficult part and i get inside my own head way too much i dont know what i expect by making this post i know it all comes down to me and me only at the end theres no jordan peterson no robbins no random youtube video that is going to help me any exercise that will help me i guess i hope to find someone to make myself accountable or someone who went through the same or maybe i hope that by admitting to someone my situation ill see how stupid im being anyway this is my most recent experience",2
outside how do i tell my mom about my social anxiety so im about to be and dont want social anxiety to ruin my social life at school this year too its honestly been terrible and i want to get help from a therapist but i dont know how to tell my mom i have lots of friends at school but i cant socialize at school the only reason i have friends is because of my ps where i can talk without anxiety i dont know what my mom would think about me going to a therapist or even a doctor she knows that i barely go outside and tries to get me to go to out but only with muslims cause she believes that other kids are bad for me im anxious to tell her of my anxiety because shell say to just go outside i was thinking that i should wait until i have a doctors appointment to mention my anxiety,2

outside i feel far out and my sleep cycle is fucked i have nothing to do not even a job at the moment though i get paid via public support through the school since im on sick leave for half a year but despite me using this time to find help from psychiatrists and stuff theres not a lot going on and its amounted to a lot of waking up playing a game browsing the web then postponing my sleep until am and eat a lot of crap to feign enjoyment my psychiatrist commented that though he understood my issues he did not find me to appear depressed and its true i can still be goofy although some days i feel like im going crazy but really most days is just me feeling miserable not talking to anybody i live on my own btw not going outside and just going through the motions i have been on sick leave since janurary i have not even called my mom to tell her that im stuck in my apartment its strange because i want to be depressed so i have an excuse for not doing anything the problem is social phobia which was already terrible a couple of years ago to the point of being debilitating but now now im so far out i think ive developed symptoms that are way worse than being anxious around others i still stay far away from other people i know or just people in the dormitory which means i never cook in the public kitchen i just feel stuck and shit im wasting my time even venting this because theres so many things i want help with on the st i have my second session with a psychiatrist he already ruled out aspergers which makes me ambivalent but i guess thats not the case but im afraid hell just prescribe me some random pills and say go figure it out i feel like i need support but i have no one,2

"baseball, run, outside cold introverted irl but easy to talk to online ive struggled with social anxiety as long as i can remember i never had many friends at school and even though i played sports for ten years baseball i never really got a social network going ever since college ive more or less lived my life online i probably spend hours most days on the computer its where i get most of my social needs met as far as thats possible i feel like two different people living in the same body one person is the face i show in public quiet passive and unassuming the other is what i show online where i tend to be extremely outgoingsilly and make a lot of jokes irl im too nervous to be who i am a fun loving extrovert because of my anxiety over the years ive managed quite the collection of bad memories at dozens of social events where i have hid snapped or run away the most recent example was a all staff meeting at work where i first went to the bathroom to avoid introducing myself to my coworkers and a half hour later had a row with one of them because of a misunderstanding i left the meeting and didnt come back ended up pacing outside for two hours before i calmed down enough to go inside the internet is the only outlet i have to really express myself because most of the social pressures in day to day interaction dont exist after sixteen years of misery im im tired of being someone im not but i dont know how to be anything else have any of you felt the same and how have you dealt with it thanks",2

outside trying to find out the development of my social anxiety depression hey guys ive been anxious and depressed enough that i cant take it anymore when i was the age of i was a funny very social empathious fun kid i always had friends always was a part of everything and everyone recognized me for my laughing untill i hit my puberty not the reason why im anxious i think since that time i got even scared to open the door i still dont have a job im now and im currently in wait for my new school which im months later then everyone else just because i canceled my other school since i was too anxious of finding a internship work place i still only have old friends from the time when i was myself and no new ones ive always been very hyper since i was a kid and then my parents decided to diagnose me and turned out i had adhd it dindt bother me at that time i do speak to my parents but not very much especially not about my feelings which i dont do with barely anyone i dissapoint them alot with my anxious feelings for example the one from when i needed to find the internship work place my mom keeps saying that im anxious because i have been judged by everyone my whole life and i know she is right but its not only that i have also been taking ritalin for a few years and from that moment everything changed one day when i felt very anxious after minutes of taking my ritalin i was in school at lunch break just with a bunch of friends because i wasnt having those anxious issues then but i felt very depressed and anxious then and i also later called my mom asked if i could go home because i was feeling sick i dindt mention that i was anxious to her next day i woke up and again took my dose of ritalin im not gonna call it medication i felt exactly the same as the day before so i called my mom again and asked if i could go home i still dindt tell about the anxious and negative thought i had from that moment i wasnt feeling myself untill this day i am feeling so tired nothing makes me happy and i just feel so fucking miserable and anxious about even doing the smallest things the worst thing is that i know i can be myself because i have been in the past but i dont know how or what to do im also using little doses of sativa or hybrid strains of weed i vaporize them and it does really help for my adhd to calm down my brains but it still doesnt make me feel myself happy from how i used to be obviously i still have some days where i feel happy but those only happen like once in a month i also once was out for dinner with the whole fam and i was feeling very drowsy and just not active but i brought my filled vaporizer dry herb vaporizer with weed so i vaped outside and i was myself again i was talking to my fam and it was like i was reborn again when i got home i was so happy and mostly proud i later said to my mom what i did when i went outside and she already knew i smoke and shes okay with it as long as i dont get addicted and she also was a bit happy because she really saw the diffrence its not always when weed works like that but when im with friends and i smoke i always feel very comfortable around them and have a good time they mostly make me forget to look at my phone so thats a good sign i really want to feel like how i used to because most people liked me then alot i also stopped growing from when i was using the ritalin and last year i have grown so much from the moment when i stopped using it i feel like ritalin fucked up my serotonin receptors because i know alot about all drugs i know that ritalin is in the same family as speed which makes it possible that it fucked up my serotonin receptors anyhow ive also tried lsd a couple of times and it made me social anxious as fuck really dindt wanna see anyone when i did that but i know that that isnt how i am because i used to be so social but how come im not anymore if anyone has tips or questions please feel free to ask tell them i use ltheanine now for a while and it makes me alot more relaxed in my head but they dont bring back the old me i dont use chemical pills ever again because theyre dangerous and addictive not only because theyre toxic itself but also because they might have fucked up my whole personality its insane that when i think of it now they just give speed to year olds because they have a disorder which makes them hyper in their head its not right thats the reason why i only use natural products to relax my brain ltheanine weed and omega i also have used xtc like times and when i do xtc i can talk to people again with no problem and it just goes extremely easy then but i dont use it more then twice a year please if anyone has any tips or comments pleasee ask or tell them also if someone knows how to like boosts my serotonindopamine receptors id love to hear how i really wanna get back to the person i used to be and im not the only one thankyou for reading lt,2

beach social anxiety holding me back in both personal and professional life hi everyone this may be a bit long but i appreciate anyone who reads even most of this andxb anyway im a m living in a big city and a social anxiety sufferer my social anxiety isnt physically crippling or physiological my physical symptoms are usually pretty limited but its mental and i am an expert in avoidance i would even say i am a very social and outgoing person in comfortable environments alcohol bars sporting events with friends or people i trust etc but when it comes to uncomfortable environments including putting myself out there and being alone doing it i avoid them joining clubssports teams going to events meeting new people talking to people at bars etc altogether andxb my social anxiety stems from insecurity and a lack of selfconfidence i wasnt beat up or anything as a kid but i grew up being bullied condescended toward and made fun of for my lack of height at the time i was one of the shortest kids in school im now and have not been insecure about this in years and for being skinny and small in general as a man in a society that often sees men like that as weak and a joke teachers told me i couldnt audition for roles because of my height kids my age made fun of me and adults made snide comments all of this contributed toward deeply ingraining into my head a fundamental insecurity i wore sweatshirts during the summer and shirts at the beach because i had terrible body image issues from the age of like long story short from an early age i was very insecure had major body image issues and terrible selfconfidence and this contributed greatly to creating my social anxiety andxb fast forward to today i am still skinny and small and find that the women who are into me tend to be years younger usually because i do look young and small for my age dating can be frustrating but i am going to the gym im starting to feel more confident in my body and i know that i have had a good amount of romantic opportunities even if it has never worked out into a relationship i feel good about myself have become extremely selfaware of my own insecurities and how i projected them in the past and in general i am content but i still cannot get over the avoidance of social anxiety its ingrained into my head andxb it has prevented me from making more friends in a new city the idea of doing a meetup or joining a club is terrifying to me and i just avoid doing that kind of thing altogether it has prevented me from say talking to women at a bar even in a drunken state when i feel good about myself it just takes over and i tell myself im not attractive that im going to embarrass myself etc it has essentially reduced my chances of meeting women to only on dating apps and it also has held me back in my career and what i want to do in life im a deeply political person but i cant network i cant bring myself to go to happy hours by myself or join political clubs or anything i simply cannot put myself out there alone into unfamiliar situations the thought of being awkward or having no one to talk to or being seen as ridiculous or an idiot these things fill my head and so avoid these situations altogether andxb i dont want to look back five years from now and not have made more friends not have taken a risk romantically by talking to someone i didnt know and not have truly tried to pursue my political dreams i have gone to therapy lately but the appointments are few and far inbetween once a month at best and while it has helped me become even more selfaware it has not helped me with well changing my brain chemistry and i dont want to be resigned to thinking this is just how i am going to be i am missing out on so many opportunities from friends to partners to careerhobbies above all i am frustrated that i have all the logical solutions to this problem who actually cares what people think of you but that does nothing for what feels like an innate reaction to unfamiliar situations i can be confident one moment and then crumble the next i get rejected in some form and it just feeds into a spiral this is very long and i am rambling but thought i would find friendly ears here maybe people in my shoes who have suggestions and have conquered or struggle with the same things i have feels nice to not be alone,2
outside i dont know about your coworkers man but i will share my experience a few weeks ago i told my mom about my sa now she notices my behavior more often when i am outside and complains about my awkwardness not that my mother is a mean person she loves me its just that she doesnt understand i am saying this because i feel sharing sensitive stuff like this with your coworkers is probably not a good idea they might start judging you and make you feel more isolated again i dont know your coworkers they might be super nice people too share it only if you are very comfortable about it,2
"forest, walk i had a norminal conversation with a cute cashier i was going from my therapy late at night and i saw this little bakery still opened with worries mounting i have decided to try venturing in to explore the dungeon i have entered the store and a really pretty girl greeted me politely likely because i was so tired that evening my brain lapsed and forgot to flip on the anxiety engagement switch so i had a quick glance over their selection of cakes and i went on to ask about whether they had any with cherries she said no but we have a tasty forest fruit mix cake i was like thats the next best thing gimme pieces of that she smiled got me my cake and said they have a special discount so late at night i paid and wished her great evening it all went so fucking smooth i did eye contact smiled asked a questionno anxiety i felt high as a kite walking home it was so rare i wish everyone such an experience tldr walked in like a boss didnt melt in front of a pretty cashier got a tasty cake",2
running nice thanks for the advice i too use to lift back when i was in high school i went from being a short skinny twig to a buff short dude it was a huge confidence boost since a lot of people noticed the progress even a teacher i had a class with freshman year was impressed with the progress i made ever since i graduated i still worked out from time to time but unfortunately i gradually stopped going to the gym the only workout that i would do was running as you may know doing a lot of cardio gradually reduced muscle mass and thats exactly what happened to me i just recently hit the gym for a week weeks ago and was shocked in how weak ive become even lifting the barbie weights seemed heavy for me i havent worked out since then due to social anxiety and time ive been thinking about hitting the gym again next week since i want to regain my buffness,2
outdoors im the exact opposite i believe i was born with sa if thats possible i just remember having it in my earliest memories avoiding the outdoors fear of being judged avoiding things i loved doing etc i started therapy when i was in the fifth grade and continued all through high school mostly exposure therapy it was hell now im out of high school off meds have an amazing career and boyfriend and i couldnt be happier its possible to come out of your shell trust me,2
parks havent been able to find any parks or anything like that around here unfortunately,2
outside if you dont know him very well its probably best to have a few conversations to give him a chance to get to know you and you him when you feel like your friendly enough maybe ask if he wants to do something outside or after school dont label it as a date or anything just ask if he wants to meet you then it can progress from there if you guys click this is just what id do you know yourself and him better than me so just do what you think would put the least pressure on both of you and allow you to get closer as a guy i can say im pretty sure hell appreciate the attention best of luck to you,2
outside i encountered this problem at the beginning of my school year im a senior and we have separate lunch periods in my school in one period i know no one and in another is every person that i know i got the former unfortunately whenever i was sitting at a table or outside sitting on some steps i wouldnt eat because i just didnt feel comfortable fortunately i switched a particular class and got my lunch period switched a few years back during my freshman year it was even worse because i knew absolutely no one and couldnt bear anyone seeing me alone so i ate alone in the bathroom i saw a whole bunch of freshman during the first few weeks eating alone and even now almost halfway through the year i still see a handful of people eating alone it makes sense to not want to eat alone though because like youve maybe heard before eating is supposed to signify that youre comfortable,2
outside anyone else not like eating in front of people im all right with family and close friends but not people i dont know well i just left college to go buy some lunch and when i got back i literally just stood outside the door listening to everyone in my class chatting theres like of us and everyone else is really friendly with each other but no one really talks to me and i wouldnt even know how to start a conversation even if i could anyway i stood there thinking about how uncomfortable it would be just sitting there eating in front of them so i decided to leave got half way down the corridor and turned back got to the door again but panicked so now im eating outside in the wet because its been raining all morning,2
outside social anxiety mistaken for arrogance or ego so whenever i go outside and unfortunately meet some of my old classmates from high school theyre all like youre such an egoistic person and you never text us or anything when in reality they never tried to contact me either even the ones i wasnt even close with tell me like oh youre such an arrogant guy you forgot about us also i never talk to my relatives and theyre like hes so rude and they all hate me i feel like im being blamed for something im not and i dont wanna be i wanna go outsocializemake friends but my anxiety and insecurities stop me from doing so and i feel even more anxious when everyone says things about me,2
"walk, running you just walk when i went to college i was living in a one room dorm with another guy naturally i was not thrilled i went to school in chicago so there was a bit more to see than your average suburb but id just start walking in a random direction at some point id decide to go in another direction and at some point id decide that id want to go home and then i would nobody looked at me weird because nobody cared what i was doing id have my earbuds in and id take my time looking at the stores and building that i passed look around there are people everywhere going somewhere different that was a mess of nonsense but heres my point you have autonomy youre allowed to do legal things that you want for no other reason than because you want to also you can walk at night if youre in a sketchy area it may not be a great idea but id regularly go running from pm because thats what worked best for me",2
"beach, swimming, beach, swim what to do at the beachswimming sounds like a stupid question but theres a possibility of me going to the beach with someone i dont know very well and was wondering what you even do i mean once you get into the water its like oh the water feels nice and then what you just say nothing and swim just stand there talkingeh and obviously feel awkward as hell cus dont exactly love how i look with a shirt off and sa",2
hiking i finnaly asked a girl to hang out i finnaly asked the girl at work to hang out with me i asked if she wanted to hang out on my day off and she said surei forgot to specify what we would be doing but she said to message her on facebook she also mentioned earlier that she liked hiking would it be weird to ask her to go hiking since we would be alone and she doesnt really know me im so excited,2
"outside, running agreed it would be easier and i understand the ops pain and frustration i can say for me where i work i manage to make friends with most of the people i work with i havent hung out with any of them outside work but i feel like i can talk with them and i can say that we are friends so if you can find work somewhere even a grocery store you might find people there who you like being around and a friendship can bloom also joining extracurricular activities like yoga classes sewing classes running clubs and other stuff can be helpful facebook groups for common interests",2
"biking, outside try going places where you would meet people since youre not employed you cant see people via work theres a big chance someone will approach you if your social anxiety wont let you approach them i like biking so ive slowly but surely started to leave the house and see placespeople whenever my anxiety lets me i tend to go when theres as little people outside as possible also when i have to go shopping always late at night",2

"camp, running, park just when i thought i had it under control so im gonna be a senior this year and ive been doing cross country bc i knew i would regret it if i didnt do it at least one year so i head to this camp all is well until today when we had this trip to the dunes long story short i was at too fast a pace to want to stick with one group of girls and too slow to catch up with another group that was headed much farther out i ended up running on my own for over an hour and a half until the assistant coach found me she went to tell some park ranger that shed found me and then ran with me to the rest of the group she explained how they were looking for me and all that which was when the anxiety started kicking in when we joined the rest of the group it was super awkward the other girls kinda looked at me and this nagging thoughtfeeling kept telling me i was a major inconvenience to them and that i had ruined what could have been a perfectly nice outing i feltfeel that no one really wanted me there im worried that it seems as if i was slacking off or something to them when in reality i was running the whole time worried and anxious swatting away atplucking off ticks that landed on my head i was running through a wooded area that was kind of swampy in some parts i probably seemed like so stupid and childish what kind of year old gets lost in the woods today was horrible i hate this feeling",2
running thanks man i went to a little buddist group and it went a lot better no friends yet but people were way friendlier and more open to talking to me im starting to recognize that the stupid running group im in is kind of just shitty like when i went to the buddist group tonight people actually came up and introduced themselves to me that didnt happen at all in the running group i was literally ignored besides one guy who said hi idk maybe the entire group has social anxiety as well the more i think about it they are a pretty cold group of people,2
park yeah i cant stand my dads wife i think she has ocd because she is constantly cleaning or complaining about how things arent clean enough she will loudly sigh or talk under her breath when she knows i can hear and havent done something to her standard my mum was abusive and a lot of the abuse was triggered by how clean everything was so it feels so scary being around this woman i end up wanting to cook food or use the toilet but too scared to leave my room or i wait at the park near my house until my dad gets home so its not just me and her i get frustrated because i come home from work and have to hide and waste so much free time waiting for her to go to bed i ended up moving out because of her with my friend for a little while but they moved too far for me to easily to commute to work so im now back in the same situation i was over a year ago its so depressing i know how you feel,2
outside thanks and ive been hunting for hobbies for years but my money is limited i live in arizona so things outside even if its in the garage arent and option of the year and i havd borderline personality disorder which has some symptoms similar to adhd so focusing to learn something new is very hard i talked to my psychiatrist about it and she wants me to try dbt before she does anything medication wise to help my focus but i dont see her until dec st so i cant even start the dbt until then im fairly happy at home aside from it feeling like a prison most of my time goes into playing around on my computer cleaning the house reading when i am able to focus some video games but not much for a similar reason as to what you said i try to get out every weekend when i have someone i can go with i dont drive but that only gets you so far really,2
running i love working out by myself though ive become so accustomed to my solitary lifestyle that i enjoy most things exclusively on my own even if i were to overcome my sa i cant really change the fact that im an introverted monster hmm i like the idea of running a marathonor half of one i really wouldnt know who to invite as most people in my life arent big on physical activity im mostly nervous about articulating myself properly i tend to be scattered when im out of my comfort zone ive tried therapy once before my therapist was so nice but she made me really anxious she was super confident and smiley and i felt like i had to emulate that even when i didnt feel the part i noticed myself omitting certain pieces of information in fear of being criticized i eventually stopped going for a while i went back and forth on giving it another shot with a different therapist because im almost certain i will benefit greatly if i find a good one trial and error is a pain i hope its worth it,2
"walk, outside while in bed do you sometimes get pumped to solve your problems but when you wake up all that willpower is all lost it can also happen while im scrolling through facebook i get the willpower to go on a diet and to take a walk outside but after a while i go back to being depressed in front of my computer this bugs me so bad",2
outside hi to be honest for me it is comforting that there are people in this world like me i really thought that i was the one who failed so much in life i didnt go to college i never had a girlfriend i lost all my friends due to my anxiety i work from home so i rarely go outside and dont meet people it hurts so much seeing happy couples in public and thinking to myself that i problably will never be able to achieve that due to my inexperience and anxiety but remember that you are not alone there are probably milions of people like you in the world i know this sucks so much and im so tired of loneliness but you have to have high hopes and pray for the best dont be pesimistic all the time im here with you,2
"walk, outside just when i thought i was getting better at this im not sure if this is the right place for this kinda thing but i just needed to get this off my chest any words of wisdom would be much appreciated ive never been diagnosed with anxiety so im not going to claim i suffer with it when theres no professional opinion on it however its seemed to be a big issue thats plagued my life for a while im grateful that im at a point where i can go out by myself sit in a shop if i want to and not feel too uncomfortable so im sat in greggs getting myself some lunch and decided id make a change and eat in just when i start thinking wow i could really do this regularly these two girls walk past spot me in the window and start laughing then as they walk keep looking back at me and keep laughing but a bit more this time then minutes later walk past the opposite way and do the same thing with increased laughter it doesnt feel good being laughed at like that it reminds me of when i used to get laughed at by girls in school idk i was feeling pretty good about myself that day and it just seemed to ruin everything for anyones curiosity im m i wasnt dressed weird and i dont stand out as odd i dont think i was wearing a grey jordans hoodie and some sunglasses im not overweight and im underweight im just a normalass slender guy so why has this made me want to never ever step foot outside again tldr thought i was doing good with my anxiety got laughed at by some girls when i was in greggs eating my lunch then realised i was doin actually doing poorly and now i wanna never set foot outside again all over something so small",2
"outside, biking i honestly have no idea how i made friends its actually pretty strange to think about it tbh it just kinda happens you dont have to be hanging out with them all the time in fact my best friend of years only started hanging out with me outside of school once we graduated you just got to be friendly and just pick the people you relate with the most i wasnt the most popular person by any means id say i was the average school goer and made like friends i still see and really close friend i hang out with every weekend depending how old youre old enough just invite some guys to the club or if youre younger invite them over to play videogames or biking or something also if someone invites you to an event force yourself to go no matter how awkward you think itll be youd be glad you did",2
"walk, outside when i was at university i would walk out of nightclubs drunk yet i still found my way home i got a reputation of the person who always went missing i remember they would give you these wristbands so that you could walk outside to smoke or whatever times i always used mine up so i had to buy another one i soon realised that partying wasnt for me",2
run omg i didnt think about the whole pokemon go thing that would be so annoying luckily for me its more of a track where i run so hopefully i wont have issues with that and lol im sorry but how did it occur that a lady called you a bastard what a weird insult,2
outside i know exactly what youre talking about dude i had this problem all throughout high school now its even worse though because it happens at work and i work on movie sets and on movie sets they usually record sound because its post which means everyone on set needs to be dead silent sometimes there are emotional scenes with long silent pauses in between actors lines sometimes theres just quiet while theyre waiting for an airplane to go by and at the end of every day or when they finish shooting in a particular space they record room tone which is just seconds of complete silence and usually these spaces are very small and filled with lots of people like the director the script supervisor the st ad the dp the st ac the nd ac the boom operator andor sound mixer talent possibly other department heads like the gaffer key grip production designer or makeup possibly multiple pas there to make sure everybody is quiet etc and if you make noise youve fucked up the take i have such severe anxiety about stomach noises on set that i basically try to avoid actually being on set as much as possible im constantly terrified of getting stuck inside when theyre about to shoot because as an electrician i might need to be nearby for small last second lighting adjustments or even worse to do a light gag lights go onoff or flickerdim during the shot i avoid it at all costs and try to stay in an area with no people or somewhere outside where its loud its a daily source of anxiety for me because i never know when i might end up in one of these situations ive noticed it seems to happen more when im anxious which is almost all the time and additionally when im anxious about it happeninglike it causes itself in a vicious feedback loop i think for me the physical symptoms of anxiety must somehow cause it because its become very evident that i get stomach problems the more worried i am for example ill be fine in the morning when i first wake up but as im driving to work i start to feel sick and i do for the first few hours of the day until i calm down basically im pretty sure the answer is just relax just chill out mentally and your body will respond by being at ease obviously this is way easier said than done for people with sa other than that just drink plenty of water eat a healthy and balanced breakfast but not too much get enough sleep exercise this is a huge one and overall just take that extra step to take care of yourself and your wellbeing pm me if you want to talk more because i guarantee you ive thought about this topic and worried over it way more than most people,2
walk i started my new first job at the end of july hours are am days a week overtime if i want it but wanted something to fit around my hnd about weeks ago i ended up waking up at am freaked out but was in work by am i practically flew down there its usually a minute walk and apologised for being late then offered to stay longer to make up the missed time it went down much better than if id rang and said im not coming in at all in fact they almost laughed it off saying that everyone does it cause of the hours that said i understand why you would do that its definitely something i considered but assumed the consequences of that would be worse than if i just turned up late,2
"outside, walk, park if people stopped filming everything everywhere a lot of us would feel more comfortable going outside is this bothering anyone else i literally cant go anywhere and not have someone film us or take pictures for example when we are eating at the university campus with some classmates some of them are filming every rd or so conversation trying to get material for their instagram stories they also keep taking pictures of their food and randomly scream in excitement while filming even if there is nothing exciting happening also pointing the camera at me because apparently its fun filming the shy dude is making me mad i took a walk at the park with some friends the other day and almost every group we met along the way was filming themselves or taking pics and consequently filming people passing by us is this actually a common thing am i whining for no reason am i just stuck with annoying people i just dont want to be filmed tldr people keep filming every social situation and its annoying",2
"outside, walk has anyone else experienced this or something like it this is gonna be a very long and personal post to an extent with some background detail for clarity hopefully someone will read through and offer some advice or likeness okay so i have been someone who suffers from social anxiety since i was about before that i was actually very outgoing and was social at my preschoolfirst gradesecond grade many things contributed to my social anxiety and thus my life long battle of depression the first notable thing was my teachers bullying me for having adhd and telling me i was too disruptive the second notable thing was my best friend in second grade ended up ignoring me because the popular girl in the class disliked me as i was very active and bubbly so thats some backstory and ever since then i have been an internet recluse everytime i tried to make friends they used me and then bullied me verbally and mentally until at i quit going to school and outside completely internet gaming specifically mmos is all ive had since fast forward i am now nearing i go to college have a job and a boyfriend of nearly years everything on that aspect is fine or better than expected for now buti fucked myself over socially when i was i made a friend group despite my social anxiety the internet is easier to socialize on for me even though i still cant order a pizza over the phone or make a dr appointment irl ive had these friends since for a very stable period but last year i had a complete social anxiety attack and went haywire i removed everyone blocked them and vanished for months i tried to come back and explain what happened but no one was having it one friend who was very close even responded lol good when she heard i was struggling i tried to reach out people to ask why i was being treated this way and they would get mad at each other for telling me something and then i got backlash for trying to reconnect and put the pieces of my social life back together this has been extremely debilitating for me and i have relapsed to my presocial ways i apologized and told them id stop bothering them to which they never responded to except that they didnt need the drama what bothers me most is that to make these friends i put myself out there and listened to when they were upset i specifically remember two of them were genuinely suicidal and i talked them through their troubles one of them said she wont speak to me because i am only trying to talk to her because no one else will and i need someone wellyeah is this not what normal friends do anyways i apologized to them all and removed them because i was only a bother and annoying i keep having small breakdowns and its leaking out in my relationship and work today at work the assistant manager seen me act very atypical and asked me if i was okay to which i kind of laughed in a hollow tone and said no and walked away everyone at work noticed and i started having an anxiety attack mid rush i work at a pizza place so it can get work heavy on weekends what do i do now has anyone else experienced this and has found a way to cope or just experienced this in general i want to make new friendsbut i just feel like a teen again and like everyone hates me tldr i was social for awhile had an anxiety attack got isolated and now i have nothing anyone relate",2

beach the end of my social anxiety is coming close to an end based on the title im sure you can guess what this post is about every since i met this girl my social anxiety has been rapidly disappearing we dated only because she secretly made a hangout a date and i recently asked her to be my girlfriend ive expressed my feeling to her and mentioned how i want to spent the rest of my life with her she feel the same way and weve even talked about kids we arent having any anytime soon but we just talked about them i then decided to start really using my social media on facebook on a handful away from friends on instagram im close to followers and on snapchat ive been posting things more often ive obviously also updated my facebook and instagram profile pictures before they are pictures of something else not me now they are im able to go out to places without feeling embarrassed for example going to the beach with a few friends and getting in the water i feel so fucking happy right now i just wanted to share it im also here if anyone has any questions or wants any kind of advice ill try my best to help you guys out since ive been treated so nice and been gratefully accepted,2

"park, runs, run i was in cross country in highschool and our coach would take us to a local park for our runs there he taught us that it is very common to say good morning afternoon evening when you pass by people he said to just wave to passer byers when we were on our faster run where we had to focus more on hitting a time so we can still be respectful a rule for eye contact and also greeting strangers is when being approached or approaching a stranger you make eye contact and if they dont immediately look away then say hello or hey whatever feels natural to you",2
soccer what can i do about this so i am a yo girl and going to be a sophomore in college i am diagnosed with social anxiety and my biggest fear is presentations everything that could go wrong goes wrong its not cute so throughout freshman year i had a number of presentations assigned to almost every class this is embarrassing to admit but i failed of my classes because i never showed up for my presentations which resulted in failing classes i am not a bad student like i want and wish i could succeed and complete my presentations but my social anxiety is so bad to the point where i literally would rather take the fs than to present in front of my classes but college is too much money to be doing that obviously and i know that there will obviously be more presentations in the future so how can i get through this and not fail my classes i cant just avoid them but is there something i could tell my teacher or someone i just dont want to be the only one not presenting and then people wonder why i got out of it you know like i want it to be fair for everyone but i just get so embarrassed and overthink every little thing andxb anyway ive just been a lil stressed about this and now im on academic probation so i cant play soccer this year ive been thinking about doing online college but then i worry too much about leaving friends not having anyone to socialize with and a whole lot of other worries i just dont know what to do with myself ya know ugh its exhausting sometimes i just wish life was easier,2
outside traveling hours on a bus by myself any tips for this ill be on a greyhound for hours im extremely nervous because ive never really been alone despite being ive always been in public or on long trips with parents or brothers i feel like a little kid even thinking about going into the bus station fills me with anxiety edited to add i have very severe anxiety especially in situations where i dont know how it will play out i know i will survive doing this but i dont feel like an adult so being alone in a foreign place is terrifying to me that being said i feel like ive made some progress i went from never going outside ever to being able to shop for groceries while my mom does something else in the same store i guess its just the idea of being so far from my comfort zone,2
"outside, running yo i dont know why but writing your thoughts down is magic sometimes the first time i did it i was outside and smoking a cigarette when suddenly i realized my thoughts were running a mile a minute almost screaming in my head for no reason at all if this had ever happened before i dont remember anyway i went up to my room opened up my laptop and just started typing poured out as many of my thoughts as i could muster and it calmed me down immensely even though you arent exactly talking it out with a person it still feels like youre getting stuff off your chest in a way",2
soccer it wouldnt matter if youre good at soccer or not it sounds like your friend invited you solely to have fun with you and in that case what counts is your presence not soccer skills cheers man,2

outside small steps matter every year i set a big personal development goal this year my goal is to be more social put myself out there and improve social skills i created an action plan so i can break my journey down into manageable steps and the first step is to start studying outside of my bedroom go to the library and be around people it is nothing fancy but i was always going straight back home after lectures to study so i was very rarely interacting with anyone even if it is just eye contact and on some days where i had no lectures id be home all day on my computer this made my social anxiety worse almost every day for the past months i have started going to the library and sitting amongst strangers which is something that always made me anxious i could have easily put my laptop in my bag and went home but i didnt not only am i able to focus more and get work done but i am also moving forward in my social goal no matter how small i used to wonder if people were judging me and watching me for just taking my laptop out of my bag or my revision notes even though everyone in the room was doing it and this is a big one for the first time i left my laptop and notepad in the library whilst i took a break outside for fresh air people didnt steal my shit people arent as scary or untrustworthy as i have often thought these are the first steps i made for myself and after a while i will start getting out my comfort zone and be more social although i am not really talking to strangers yet i still feel i am making progress next up i will be attending some workshops to try and meet people and overtime throughout this year i will start learning to small talk with strangers smiling more to strangers making phone calls volunteering initiating conversations rather than standing alone asking a girl multiple girls out so i can finally get started as a late bloomer in this dating world and i might even travel on my own small steps matter,2
outside pls help i feel hopeless and unmotivated constantly i try my best to have a positive mindset but not being able to go outside and the amount of people who constantly insult me is taking its toll can i talk to a specific user once everyday or something we can talk about our troubles our successes our interests just stuff in general id most likely be available at pm gmt everyday i play games read watch anime and when i had an ounce of motivation i used to do programming and extra mathsand spanish and frenchnot that i spent all too long doing spanish mais je parle le franais dcentpour mon ge bien sr,2

outside and from what ive seen in the comments calling the guy a dickhead and a asshole for being a little outgoing is the answer to getting over your sa the man was just being friendly i didnt mean to tell you to get over it im just saying dont take everything to heart and read into everything amd have it ruin your day i used to do that and sometimes still do but people dont know when someone has sa or a thin skin so just keep that in mind lol you people need to go outside more seriously this sub is just a circlejerk of hey look how fucked up my sa is dont give me advice on how tp work on it just agree with me that sa sucks,2
outside birthday parties are the worst went to my best friends birthday party i thankfully didnt need to introduce myself to everyoe because when i got there only her friends brother family friends and her brothers girlfriend were there and my best friend and her mom and i joined in on a card game not saying a lot but definitely talking every now and then her niece came and everything was still great but then her other friends came whom she knew way before we met and everyone started talking and everything was loud and i just sat there eating snacks every now and then i smiled a lot and just listened to everyones conversations but i didnt really chip in because whenever its crowded like that i just get stuck sometimes people asked me something or included me in a conversation but id say something for ten seconds and then itd be back to just listening i feel so embarrassed now my best friend asked me multiple times whether everything was ok not literally asked more like thumbs up or down because she knows i have bad social anxiety and afterwards she went outside with me and told me she was really glad i came to her party even though i shouldnt have had to come because she knew how hard this was for me she told me she was really proud of me and that she was impressed i managed to stay for so long which i did because it was too loud and i didnt know how i had to say that i wanted to leave so when everything fell silent i took my chance and said i was tired and was gonna leave but that we could have also just gone out the two of us for her birthday i definitely dont think shes mad or anything at me but im really scared now that she thinks i had a horrible time which i didnt i felt awkward the whole time sure but i like listening to people talk and everyone was really nice that everyone especially her old friends thought i was being weird i am dying inside ok bye,2
beach most of the time when i try to make plans they never work out i planned a beach trip with my friends and everyone agreed to go but of course everyone including me out of the blue cant go because they have stuff to do my parents divorced years ago and its been rough since then ive developed social anxiety since then and have felt pressure to have more friends ive barely done anything this summer and i feel like a loser on top of that i only have half of my summer to do things because im at my nasty fathers house for one week at a time its so disgusting here and im embarrassed to have anyone over or hang out when im here because it smells and i for some reason smell bad when im at his house im currently and dont want to live like this anymore any advice,2

running hemp oil sleeping and not smoking weed works so well for me i was a mess i accused my friend of being a legit psychopath and began to think other people i know are psychopaths i got three hours of sleep and was high the night before college orientation and it didnt go so well when my mom picked me up from the two day orientation i was tired and irritable argued with her about religion yeah i dont like christianity that much but im usually respectful and not a complete dick like i was she ended up crying not from the arguing but when we were arguing about me getting better and i was saying how i know what i need right now more than her which is true we made up and the next day i tried taking my hemp oil again wow the best day ive had in maybe a year i was so confident when i went to the movies with my friends i wasnt on edge and insecure i also forgot to mention that ive been getting at least hours of sleep with no melatonin or anything ive been alternating going to the gym and running i smoked four days a week before for about three weeks and now ive been sober for four days and have no desire to smoke weed ive found what works for me,2
outside i dont know where you live but if its america its probably one of the safest places in the world the s were a strange period in america during which anything even slightly unknown became a sense of paranoia every stranger was out to kidnap andor rape andor sell marijuana which will lead to them instantly being addicted to heroine to your child every film book or video game was a satanic trap that would warp your childs mind and make them obsessed with violence and sex pretty much every one of those things is a complete and utter lie children are much much more likely to be abused or kidnapped by adults they know the entire war on drugs is ridiculous and counterintuitive games and movies havent lead to an increase in violent behavior in fact america and the rest of the world has become immensely safer over the last century not only will you be safe outside in your neighborhood but you will be safer than any time in history youll be ok,2
park you gentlemen in this thread should go over to rnofap and give it a try ive given this a try and found that while the anxiety isnt completely gone it has been reduced by a noticeable amount i went out to the park to vlog and talked to strangers and almost got this girls number wouldnt hurt to give it a go but you def have to have some discipline good luck bros,2

tennis this my freshman year i joined the tennis team and on the first day while we were waiting for our coach to arrive i was really nervous because everybody else seemed to know each other there was this other freshman however that i recognized because i had played him before in a tournament i was nervous as hell but just said fuck it and went up to him and was like hey didnt we play each other a couple months ago at some tournament we didnt have a very meaningful conversation but it was enough for us to see each other as more than just strangers we began talking more throughout the year and eventually became friends soon he introduced me to his friends and so on,2
outside a week i havent been outside in months,2
skating i experience this to an extent as well it kinda feels like everything you post is going to be carefully examined and critiqued by everyone following you i just like to post things that represent who i wish people knew i was for example i really like skating and taking care of dogs but i dont get to tell people often in reality so i just post photos of me skating and taking care of dogs on ig its also important to remember that nobody is going to be carefully analyzing every post you make theyll probably just give it a glance maybe a like and keep scrolling it seems kinda mean to say that nobody cares but i doubt many people think twice about anything that others post,2
outside i just sometimes cant find what to talk about especially with my girl friends and only saying hi to them only makes them think im boring and i am not really worth to talk with i almost never got invited to hang around outside or to birthday parties in my life all i do is sit at home infront of my computer all day all of my classmates dont care even slightly about me and pretend as if i dont exist at all this hit home idk whats wrong with us,2
outside social media is not the real world granted most use it and way too often but i strongly believe the most successful people find their successes away from their computers or smartphones if you cut down on facebook and replace it with nothing then voila you just get more lonely but disconnecting could also be the moment of truth when you start feeling truly bored and instead of getting an easy fix by browsing facebook youll actually force yourself outside more instead,2
outside sure most of the time i get a feeling that im not even part of the society everywhere outside i go it seems like people are pushing me out of there really drags me down of course its partially just in my head and my anxious behaviour does the rest but that doesnt really matter,2
running cant fricken connect to anyone even after putting myself out there so over the past few months ive really really been trying to connect to people and make friends but no matter how hard i try it never leads anywhere i joined a running group and starting talking to people in that group first couple of times had a few conversations with people that lead no where the third time i decided to just sit back and observe you know what i noticed pretty much everyone just converses with their one or two friends and ignores everyone else they are nice enough that they will talk to you if you talk to them but the split second you go silent they will go right back to ignoring you and talking with their buddies ive tried talking to classmates im in grad school but the conversation always just ends up with us talking about school and then trailing into silence andxb like im so fucking far out of practice that i just dont even know how to converse with people i have zero idea how to keep a conversation going or even make it remotely interesting i hate myself thanks for listening to my rant andxb,2
"camp, outside while i was always the shy and quiet kid i think i would have grown out of that if it werent for an experience i had when i was i went to the gaeltacht irish speaking summer camp weeks only speaking irish away from home when i was and it was an amazing experience i made new friends from all over the country fell in love with the language laughed so much every day we stayed in houses and in each house was leaders which were super bubbly talkative people who had to bring us out of our shell break the ice in the early days make sure we didnt speak english and they also ran daily activities i knew i was shy but i wanted to be a leader and i thought if i didnt know anyone then id be able to be that talkative and bubbly when i was i went as a leader everyone was so so extroverted and because we were being evaluated by our superiors being watched to see how well we mixed and interacted with other people i got stage fright and didnt talk to anyone it was horrible i felt so ashamed of myself for thinking i could do this and for being the only one who was shy they must have been thinking what the hell is she doing here long story short none of the other leaders liked me like they hated me theyd talk to me and id be super quiet and theyd do the okaaaaay and their eyes would dart around and smile at someone when they talked to me they also gave me grief one day because this boy asked me out they were making fun of me which hurt because the girl who was laughing at me was once my leader when i was a student and i used to be the type of kid who would idolise and have faith in people this experience broke that we have one day where parents visit and most people go to a neighbouring town for lunch with them i saw the other leaders and said hi and they blanked me to give context this wasnt a job leaders tend to form a close knit group and i was outside of this we had a day out to the cinema and there was no room on the bus so i had to go in a teachers car the teacher shouted into the bus who wants to come with me and aoiphes in the car no one moved anyway i dont know why exactly but my faith in others and more importantly myself broke and is still broken i actually blocked the experience out i used to think about it at night and literally sweat and cry and push it out of my mind it was humiliation straight weeks of it im leaving specific bits out because theyre hard to describe but a lot of my flashbacks were of peoples expressions of suppressed laughter anytime i spoke to them or another leader rolling her eyes at me for not being good enough it was like you know when you do something silly by accident in front of people and you think about it for years but the amount you think of it decreases with time well its like that only happening continuously for weeks i honestly think i got ptsd from that experience it took me years to allow myself to think about it and it was painful my description probably doesnt make it sound that bad but it was just things happening over and over again that confirmed for me that i was a failure and everyone hates me learning negative things about yourself one after the other with no time to process its been better lately sometimes i think about it without cringing again this probably sounds like a relatively normal experience but it was just overwhelmingly negative and honestly ruined my life",2
"run, walk noticed ive been staying at home a lot the last couple days advice hi ive noticed i havent left the house much in the last couple of days apart from to get food so spend like an hour out the house and then come back im working on fiverr atm and making quite a lot of money from it much more then a job would give me and its freelance so i can set my hours etc i guess my question is a two part thing the first thing is that im aware that my job working from home in my music studio is quite isolating but also if im more comfortable working this way and am making way more then a anyway do i really need a i still go out and socialise and see my mates on the weekend at least but most of my days im alone working and then go out for nights out if im invited my days atm basically is mostly making music for people all day and then i try and get out for a run or go to the shops for an hour or so in between but sometimes if my mates dont have work they will invite me to stuff and ill go second part of the question is does anyone else do this like find themselves staying at home a lot like say if theres a day where i dont have work to do id still choose to stay at home and chill instead of go and walk around the city aimlessly like if i dont have a plan ill just spend my day at home i dont even view it as an anxiety thing really im just not great at doing stuff on my own and if i do like i dont really see the point in just aimlessly walking around the city with nothing to do because theres nothing to do ahahah andxb what do you guys do when your alone and dont have work that day do u guys stay at home all day and chill also is this ok to do assuming youve got work on other days like i do any advice would be great thanks guys",2

outside what was the funniestcringiest thing you did when trying to avoid people yesterday one acquaintance called me on the phone while i was using the subway i muted the ringing by pressing the lockscreenbut the cringey part was that he was watching me with his friend from behind did you saw me was the question and it was obvious that i liedi didnt saw him because i was facing the other way i was avoiding to speak to himd i didnt know that he was behind me dunno why he didnt shout just called me on the phone to check if i would pick up maybe testing me so this time they caught me other times i look the other way because i feel anxious speaking to people that i know also looking through the doors peephole if a neighbour is outside in order to wait for him to go back inside so i can leave the house i find that when i laughfind the funny things about something that made me depressed or anxious in the past i overcome it,2
outside sa has made me change my opinions on things ive always liked rain but now i like it because there are less people outside and i imagine it changes peoples priorities to not go judge people and instead seek shelter get inside their car asap etc,2
outside i know exactly what you mean ive pretty much been a shutin for years but decided it was time to make some changes a few years ago i was seeing some support workers every other day started seeking help from a psychologist went to support groups tried volunteering and even got into working out to the point that i was eventually going to the gym everyday anyway long story short i met a guy whilst at the gym and id say we became friends he was a regular at the gym i went to and kindly helped me with getting used to working out and how to do everything correctly we got on well since we both had similar interests and he had dealt with mental health issues as well so he seemed to be very patient and understanding with me we would see each other almost everyday at the gym and work out together regularly although not many conversations were had since neither of us were overly talkative but whenever we did i almost felt lost it seemed like a huge challenge just to think of something to say and im sure there were many times when i was unintentionally offensive or inappropriate i think about conversations ive had days ago or even years ago what could i have done differently maybe if i was more talkative or showed some emotion id still have friends around months after meeting him i kind of just woke up one morning and felt like it had all been a huge lie since when am i able to talk to people or go outside on a regular basis im ashamed to say that the realisation of all that sent me into a bit of a tailspin which had resulted in me being back to that person who barely goes outside or does anything ever i only have myself to blame,2
walk talked to a cute person today is it weird to smile was on a walk and talked to a cute guy walking his dog i think he was looking at me before but i didnt want to weird him out by smiling at him or something is this weird had a short conversation literally just introduction and what schools we go to i didnt want to stick aroudn too long to i was like see ya and left haha it already felt too weird talking to him in the first place he was smiling the whole time tho and was nice any points of improvement,2
park i tried tinder before but no luck probably because im just not attractive im trying okcupid now and tinder again made them today so far so shit but i didnt exactly expect a fucking miracle that soon i dont know of any fucking clubs near me and the park probably not the best time of year for that i tried meetup but im not sure where to start there are so many fucking groups idk which to pick or what definitely not going to do yoga but i get what youre saying when you made that point putting myself into situations is where im at a loss youd think me going to the gym and being on the train every day would be one but i guess not gym more so than the train and im not sure ill meet someone eventually if i was unable to do so in school and i dont evne know what fucking girls im interested in if i never had a gf i have no basis really just no hyper feminists or annoying people and oddly enough the few okcupid profiles i browsed several of them were hyper feminists just my fucking luck,2
"park, hiking i f really want to kiss this guy m that i have known for a couple months but i am afraid it will ruin the relationship i asked this guy who is friends with a mutual guy friend of mine if he could help me with my chemistry college class he said sure and he has helped me a few times i jokingly kissed him on the cheek once and he smiled and chuckled one time we were kind of flirting and i put my hand on top of his and he held it we just sat there kind of nervously looking at each other and chuckling he was kind of biting his lip kind of like he wanted to say or do something but he didnt know what he should do i texted him and asked him if he wants to go to this park where you go hiking and he said yes do you think he likes me should i try to kiss him on the lips if so what is the best approach he is and im what should we do when we go to the park i want to kiss him but at the same time it might backfire and end up straining our friendship or maybe something good could come from it idk i know once you kiss someone your relationship tends to change because now youre crossing into that friends with benefits relationship tldr i really want to kiss this guy but im afraid it will backfire and ruin the relationship",2
outside did anyone else grow up isolated growing up i wasnt allowed to watch movies rated higher than pg or play games rated higher than e i remember that for movie days in class my parents often wouldnt sign my permission slip i also wasnt supposed to watch bad tv like spongebob or the simpsons i wasnt allowed to have a cell phone until like eighth grade and even then it was a shitty flip phone in the early years of smart phones coincidentally we also didnt live around any other kids the school bus didnt even come to our house my parents would still force me to go outside sometimes when they felt i had spent too much time on the computer no internet of course even though there was literally nothing for me to do except maybe throw a frisbee at my brother who is four years younger than me a huge age difference for a preteen my parents werent narcissistic or religious nuts maybe a bit overprotective but i feel like the rules they had for me prevented me from making friends in my early development which is of course a very important time to make friends and whats worse is i think they relaxed their rules for my younger sibling and now hes in high school and from what ive heard he has lots of friends and does school sports and other extracurriculars i would not be surprised if he has his first relationship before me maybe i shouldnt think this way but the day that happens is the day that whatever meager self worth i have will be extinguished anyone else,2

forest had one of the lowest days yet today i have been living with social anxiety and depression for six years now it started when i hit puberty sadly i am about as stubborn as anxious which has lead me to some pretty dark times there have been worse moments in those six years like waking up to police kicking down your door to bring you to a psych ward my mum not letting me inside the house for days to make me tough and my anxiety disappear thanks for that or when i was being put in a home for disfunctional children but ran away again and again hiding in a forest and shit i am living in my small little apartment and havent interacted with anyone for four months except my mum who is caring for me which is honestly very nice of her but you can tell she is about to cut off contact anyway today workers had to come to fix something in my apartment the first time someone besides me or mum was about to enter my apartment i couldnt handle it i didnt sleep yesterday night because i was feeling so on edge and didnt eat today yet because of the stomach ache my anxiety is causing i asked my mum to come and be here when they come so i could get away you could see the moment she realized i am still an anxious wreck if not way worse she refused to drive me to her place so i had no place to stay at so i grabbed her car keys and got in her car what i am trying to say is that i basically sat in a car for four solid hours today because the workers didnt say exactly when theyd come and guess what last minute they called my mum letting her know they couldnt make it today and theyd come back in the next few days i am pathetic plus my mum screamed at me because she doesnt understand kind of bummed my suicide attempt last week didnt work good thing nobody noticed tho,2
soccer team sports has been my source of anxiety since i was and led to systematic bullying throughout the final years leading into highschool and thats when i started to feel alienated for good i have so bad memories that i sometimes consider if its a genuine trauma ive never overcome it and i still feel have issues talking to people in fear that theyll invite me to play soccer almost a hilariously bad coincidence as an example lol i do know someone else though who was even more shy than me but he played soccer just fine when i stepped onto the field the ball made me scared the first real sign of my crippling anxiety and i always quit as early as i could and people started yelling at me for being a bad sport,2
outside be outside alone i have to be accompanied by people who help me or a family member study depression stops studying at home to be possible work and look for a job contact old friends and be with them play multiplayer video games that judge scare exists even online for me speak to internet friends i have to be real drunk to dare start a conversation due to my stutter i think its pretty impossible for me to get a girlfriend but i dont want any kids anyway so pretty much everything outside at home and a pretty large part of the internet,2
outside yes quit college last year quit my job on november i dont really go anywhere just bored at home all day some days id rather not eat than go outside to get food,2
"hikes, outside, beach something that helps me not feel bored with my bf is making plans even if its just for a regular date we plan a time and place a week in advance we get food go to a movie or play go on hikes pretty much all things you can do without too much social interaction with outside people lol its fun and gives both of you something to look forward to we also discuss things like trips around the world and to the beach and whatnot just as a fantasizing type thing its something exciting to talk about and honestly makes me look forward to the future instead of fearing it",2
park dont stay too long park officials or security guards might say youre not allowed sleeping in the park and potentially get you into trouble,2
"walk, hiking, beach thank you for your advies gonna definitely follow it your story about your childhood sweetheart realy hit home when i was my besfriend broke up with her long term bf and started geting closer to me and then confessed that she loved me and i already had a tiny crush on her so we decided to try it out didnt last long we went on diffrent dates first date we just went to the movies and later ate at a restaurant and walked around after that day she ghosted me for weeks and then started talking to me again and said sorry and wanted to try again second date i went hiking with her and watched the sunset and ate at a pizza place after that day she avoided me for a few days with a bunch excuses then asked me out again and i was like sure third date we went to a restaurant then walked by the beach and saw the sunset she kissed me that night and told me why she avoided me all those days apperntly she was scared we would destroy our friendship and she already lost her bofriend and didnt wanna lose me too well i accepted her but few days later i went out with a cousin to watch some movies and a saw her walking with her neighboor she told she was studying at home and then they started kissing they looked so inloved it kinda hurt becuase she was my befriend and lied to me but i grabbed my phone took a picture of them send it to her and told her with a message i just saw you and i dont think we can be friends anymore and i ghosted her after that i cut all contact with friends of hers and family first time i ghosted someone i like to tell myself its no big deal but it really hurts when someone you trust betrays you like that this event isnt really the reason for my anxiety but it sure made a bit worse i think i had a rough childhood parents were really aggrasive and both are introverts and when i was diagonesed with anxiety as a kid my parent decided to try not to fight in front of me anymore they didnt do a good job at it aslo tey started ignoring me becuase they thought they were toxic for me to be around them so i grow up with introverted parents that argued violently in front of me and isolated me afcouse they werent bad parents they did the best that they good they fucked me up mentally but i didnt starve i have a home education i am doing fine so they did great job and i love them for it",2
outside i feel hopeless i am years old i have depression and social anxiety for as long as i can remember i literally wasnt outside for months i am avoiding everything i can i should move out from my town and go to college and study but i cant even go outside i feel like my life is over all of my friends are living their lifes with their loves and i am lying in bed thinking about death my therapist was always busy and i had sessions like max in a month and i felt like it wasnt really helping and i tried different medications and my mood is shit anyway i cant relax,2

outside neighbor probably hates me my very pregnant neighbor got locked out of her apartment this morning she got locked out from the outer door which leads to a small corridor to both our apartments i must have been in the back listening to my headphones and didnt realize she was ringing the door bell she ended up having to call maintenance to let her back inside later on i went out for a cigarette and she was outside and mentioned that she got locked out i just said oh and went back inside after i closed the door i felt like such a jerk because i shouldve said im sorry i was in the back next time it happens ring the doorbell or knock on a window now she probably thinks i just didnt want to help im a btch i wish i wasnt so socially awkward with people because it comes off as being meaninconsiderate maybe im overthinking it,2
outside in my early teen years i had friends and were outside having fun then when i was around it went to shit and i isolated myself and still am isolated i never graduated from high school though i did study the base classes from there math english etc in a special school afterwards girlfriends never had one unless testing what sex is as a year old with a one year older female friend i liked is one but i doubt that and pretty sure i will never have one unless i fix my problems and i have no motivation to do that,2
"outside, run, beach holy shit dude every single detail is me sitting in my room in the weekends hearing whats going on outside and wishing i could be a part of it reaching for the door knob counting to trying to get the courage to use the restroom only to end up pissing in a bottle to avoid seeing my roommate hella embarrassing to admit the life of solitude you mentioned has always appealed to me i want to run away and live in the middle of nowhere away from everyone the woods the beach anywhere i dont care good luck to us both",2
outside how to find reasons to go outside im getting bored tired and lonely doing indoorintroverted activities how do you guys come up with things to do outside with other people i need reasons to socialize and am not sure how to go about doing so ive tried meetups in the past for sa and other things but what do normal social people do how do they meet people and how to they make friends and network,2
outside i never leave the house i dont remember the last time i left the house i waste all my time online the only time i go outside is when im going to work thats it i spend the rest of my time rotting away i keep telling myself i cant go on like this but i dont have the know how to improve and i am terrible and unable to function around people this is it this is my life this is how its gonna be until im dead fucking depressing,2
park i picked weeds at a local park with other students from my university everyone there were so introverted and shy that it made so uncomfortable that i took initiative and led the conversation but then i realized everyone got comfortable as soon as we broke up as a group of the others were just like me there,2
"park, walk tbh i do this all the time i always park where there arent a lot of cars even if the walk is long my campus isnt that big luckily but i always go to the lot with fewer cars bc theres so much people and traffic in the parking deck",2
"pool, swim so coffee didnt happen ill link to the original post but long story short i asked a guy to coffee everything was going fine but then he sort of dropped off of texting and snapping conversations wasnt really interested in the conversation wouldnt initiate etc you know all the regular bad signs i left it a few days and then snapped him a pic of me at the pool swimsuit pic lol and was like what are you up to and he opened it and never replied so then i got embarrassed and also a little panicky feeling like coffee would be super awkward and weird he told me that he would text me the night before for a time etc but that he might forget because he was super forgetful implying i should reach out if he didnt and i came up with this plan that if he reached out i would talk to himgoplan etc but i was not going to reach out myself i just planned to let it die and then he didnt reach out surprise surprise the time we were supposed to have coffee has come and passed now i feel awful and down i realize hes not the only guy out there or anything obviously but it still sucks ive just never really had luck with guys like ever in my whole life and so sometimes i get this harebrained idea to try to make things happen myself and it always backfires og link",2
"park, sun, outside im so proud of myself i hung out with a new friend despite my anxiety giving me hell for it so im just finishing my first year of uni and like ive barely interacted with my flatmates this year ive been a complete hermit and i hate myself for it but a couple months ago i spoke to a girl from my flat on snapchat a bit and we agreed we should hang sometime when we were both free from uni work and we had a couple good conversations between then and now but today we finally hung out and it was so nice we went to the park and just sat in the sun and chatted and stuff but i had such a nice time and im so fucking happy and proud of myself that i was able to overcome my anxiety after a year of being dominated by it i was scared shitless all morning terrified itd be awkward or something would happen or whatever but nothing went wrong at all the conversation was fine she had a good time i had a good time we were there way longer than i anticipated i feel so proud of myself and happy that i made a friend for the first time since moving to this city last september i dont feel alone if i can do it you can do it go outside of your comfort zone try new things even if they make you anxious especially if they make you anxious",2
outside sa in its purest form the only way to change it is to keep saying hello to people despite your sa making you not want to and to change your thinking patterns changing your reaction from negative to positive or at least to neutral is essential recently ive been able to laugh at myself a lot more awkward interactions just amuse me now naturally i am pessimistic so just trying not to give too much of a fuck is all i can do to be able to go outside or talk to people again lol just keep trying exposure therapy works,2
walk if you somehow got a gf would you handle it if a perfect girl somehow showed up and wanted to date you would you even give it a try after years of fighting with social anxiety i finally got to the point where i can go with a girl for a walk or coffee without getting a panic attack but i realised im still far from a point where i could even think about dating heres a short list of what im scared of introducing her to familyfriends going to partiesweddings together getting rejected by her after some time organizing our own wedding i know its long way but id never be able to do it anyone else,2
park no way man i went to the park pokestop lure and gyms there and omg there were old people children teens college kids moms and dads with their kids i mean a old people total mix dont let that stop you im and play love the community people actually approach to speak to me nicely and we have a convo never happens,2
"run, swimming can you give me the strength to get off my phone and tell people i wanna go to bed weve just run a km and i dont feel like talking or swimming i just wanna go home but im so awkward and too weak to stand up for myself and say good night cause theyre not expecting it but i suppose im kind of boring rn",2

"running, outside what am i supposed to when im running out of people to talk to i would go outside but my parents wont let me because they think its unsafe and when i try to talk to people on facebook almost all of them leave me on seen ive tried playing games and watching stuff but it feels agonizing not to be able to interact with actual people at this point i really dont know what to do",2
hiking anyone have a fear of driving in front of others ive been shysocially anxious my whole life a weird quirk is that i hate driving other people i get nervous for some reason i dont hang out with many others and usually like others to drive because it makes me more comfortable and relaxed its so weird while driving i get nervous about how im driving what music to listen to if i should change it the volume and my stereo volume knob barely works and some of my car interior is kinda falling apart lol im going on a second date with a guy hiking and he is new to town our first date went super well and i actually ended up staying the night at his place but we are meeting at my apartment since my apt is halfway there and i told him i could drive ya there or he could i should probably drive since i know the way and hes never been there but for some reason im getting major anxiety help lol i know i have weird fears,2
"walk, outside ive had this so bad that i could just not think about anything else while walking outside i now listen to music any time im outside to distract myself plus im trying to tell myself like well so what youll never see these people again anyway but thats a bit harder to make myself believe but the music really works for me",2
"running, run i find a problem with every community i could become a part of im and this is something i struggle with a lot it feels like most communities i have tried to be a part of have features around them that made me distance myself from being a part of that community i understand that i am the problem in this situation and im probably overgeneralizing everything here are some examples i enjoy casual gaming but not enough to care about gaming news or events i feel like a huge amount of people in the gaming community my age are overly edgy rage a lot over games or are neckbeardy which scares me off i also hate playing video games for hours on end i get burnt out really easily and gamers usually like to have long sessions with each other i drifted away from my gaming friends because the burnout from playing video games for hours at a time was too much for me i enjoy hip hop and r andb but a lot of the culture around this for my age is associated with people who smoke weed drink and go clubbing which intimidates me as i dont like the loss of control associated with drugs and loud carefree environments like clubs i also feel like theres huge pressure to be on social media within this community in high school i was friends with people who were into this community a lot and as they got older we drifted apart as they became clubbers and big on alcohol etc i enjoy football but i hate the competitiveness that comes with playing it even socially youll get shouted at or made fun of for mistakes and there is a hyper masculine drinking community stereotype associated with casual footballers my age i also am terrible at football i have always dabbled in and out of this community but as i was never very good i didnt really get any respect and i found playing a very high pressure scenario all the above seem like immaturity problems but there are other communities ive tried to get into that i didnt have this problem with but i just didnt enjoy being a part of them for example i have tried an art community but i am not very good at art which made me embarassed whenever i went to the classes and the way i think i naturally struggled to make and critique art i also just felt very uncomfortable in this environment which i think may be due to the fact that im not very passionate about art im happy i at least tried though i have tried a board game community but i found it too nerdy for me and i just didnt find any of the board games we played fun i just didnt feel engaged enough and as passionate as the others were about the games and the people in the group were all a lot older than me im constantly looking for communities i can join which i will feel comfortable with i am thinking maybe a running community however i am worried that this problem is going to follow me everywhere since i seem to perfectionistic about who i be friends with like i already know i dont care about run times and stuff so i may feel out of place being surrounded by people who do care if anyone else has dealt with this it would be great to hear some advice thanks",2
run that sounds really cool i started thinking about creating games during my phase of playing dota and mastering it during the entirety of my puberty i wondered how developers created the metas and the maps and items ect and i was thankful for there work what type of games are you studyingworking on developing like on pc appstore or console games also what games do you play for the gym i can tell you since ive been doing a lot of research about health nutrition and bodybuilding it all depends on what your goal is like to be just fit lose couple pounds to lose a ton of weight or to gain muscle remember those huge bodybuilders had to start somewhere what body builders usually do or skinny people is bulk up eat a ton more then they workout out gain more muscle and strength and then cut do more cardio eat less to get the sixpackdefined muscles but you can also do cardio to fill out before you start lifting if i would have to give couple tips for working out it would be consistency diet not worrying about results you can workout your hardest but if you still eat like shit you will not get results now since i told you you shouldnt eat like shit you might ask the question what should i eat or maybe i cant afford organic or good foods or something along the line im going to be a diets will not work for you and when i mean diet i mean just going on a diet for couple weeks and then stopping and going back to what you usually eat you have to make a lifestyle change that means quitting foods that are making you gain weight and replacing foods that make you not gain weight ill tell you straight up what worked for me ok heres what i do i would waking up early and then run a mile everyday with empty stomach w only water then for lunch everyday i ate a salad which i hate and water lastly when i got home i ran another mile and for dinner i ate either starches fruits and veggies sleep is also essential because thats where you lose weightgain muscle that would be my diet plan to lose weight fast but if you ever want long term results your going to have change your lifestyleeating habits and either eliminate reduce or replace them i can also give a list of amazing foods and a book that i would recommend for people trying to lose weight that sounds amazing that you got on a date its fine do whatever seems right i would get her talking about her life get to know her more you have to master the skills of listening to keep the convo going with follow up questions or relating stories and then ending the convo with like another date or something dont get to nervous we are here to help sorry bout the long ass rant just trying to help good luck on the date,2
"walk, run crossing streets i dread crossing streets because theres just so much to consider if the hand signal is on i feel like everyone in their cars are watching me standing all awkwardly and its worse if there are no cars coming but there are other people with me because i feel like they expect me to jaywalk if i start to jaywalk and a car suddenly appears then the driver will get mad and everyone at the sidewalk will see me as some idiot who almost got killed for being impatient even though i wasnt being impatient i just started crossing because i was afraid of looking awkward in the event that i didnt cross and i couldve because there were no cars on the other hand if the walking signal is on thats good and in most cases no problem but the worst is when you only have like seconds left to cross so im not sure if i should start crossing since i might not make it in time and i dont want to run because in th grade people said the way i run is funny so literally ever since i never want to run in public lol and if i dont make it in time everyone in their car will be upset at me and see me as some idiot who doesnt know when to cross the street but if i decide to wait then i just look silly because maybe i couldve made it and in their heads theyre all like why didnt that weird guy cross the street lol so what ive been doing recently is whenever im not sure if i should cross or not i sort of pretend to walk away from the crosswalk and go on my phone pretending to be busy this way i avoid both people in their cars and other pedestrians im still worried that people can tell what im doing but its not as bad as the other scenarios or of course sometimes i just avoid the crosswalk altogether if theres a bridge or something nearby i just find it very frustrating that something as simple as crossing the street is this huge obstacle for me im terrified of something going wrong and my poor judgment when im anxious anyways wonder if others can relate to this just wanted to vent and share",2
outside all throughout high school i sat by myself during lunch i was too nervous to eat in front of people so i actually didnt eat lunch we had more freedom in high school over where we could be during lunch hour meaning we didnt all have to be in that crowded cafeteria i would sit outside and stayed busy listening to music reading or doing homework i did have this cool teacher one year who let students eat and study in her classroom during lunch even when i wasnt her student anymore she told me i was still able to go there to read or do homework,2
outside ive traveled solo in japan during my exchange year there i made sure i had a few places of interest to go to in each city i visited i think thats pretty important when traveling alone depends on your personality of course but for me going in without any kind of plan and just expecting to have a good time like that would have been a doomed attempt many times i wished i had a friend to go with but at the same time i was happy to be able to go at my own pace and only to places i enjoyed and to eat food i actually liked as opposed to having to adapt to the tastes of other people when choosing restaurants and cafes at one point i ended up having to spend the night in central tokyo and unlike in my home country the main train station was not open all night so i had to spend some hours outside by myself which was a bit unnerving but it ended up being just fine luckily having someone with you is going to be more safe so youll want to take that into consideration when making plans that some things might be dangerous or unwise to do all on your own but thats kind of obvious probably sadly i missed my only chance of making new friends on that trip by feeling terribly nauseated one day and having to decline when a fellow tourist asked me out for coffee on the street despite not really meeting new people on my trip i had a lot of new experiences and fun too,2
"walk, outside friendless people the key to not feeling like the worst person in the world is to stop caring to state the obvious for a while i never understood people who posted on here and on other subs saying they have no friends but theyre okay with that if theyre okay with it it wont change but i was wrong of people are going to think youre a weirdo for not having friends but they dont know you and theyre shallow no one is going to support your loneliness so you might as well accept that sometimes shit happens in life and you end up alone for a while but thats okay and natural i think the guilt of loneliness affects your mental health before the actual loneliness does growing up i became more and more aware of my lack of friends i had more friends then than i have now but less than most people i knew for a long time i didnt see the problem when i didnt see my lack of friends as a problem this meant that when i was having a social interaction i wasnt self conscious i didnt have my mothers voice in the back of my head telling me i should have more friends i remember in school between the ages of i would yap and yap to anyone and no i didnt make friends with everyone i talked to but i made some and was generally liked as i got older i cut off a group of friends from my home town because i had nothing in common with them and they were preoccupied with being popular and i wasnt my mam would always say that i needed more friends when she noticed i stopped hanging around them i remember i brought friends home for dinner and my sister said oh look her friends all of them i became more aware of my loneliness as my awareness increased i got more withdrawn basically a hermit was overly critical of myself and overly self conscious because everyone around me was telling me it wasnt okay to have few friends even though i had been happy something that struck me in college was how everyone sort of acted as if they wanted to be perceived as popular this was probably my warped sa perception and this stopped me from talking to people sometimes i read threads here particularly rrelationships my favourite sub and see people talking about how having no friends is a red flag and that boring people finish last and that when you have no friends youre the common denominator and theres something wrong with you i see where theyre coming from and while reading things like this serves to make us all more self aware it doesnt make it easier and its not healthy to blame yourself i had an epiphany recently and i realized that people in my hometown probably dont talk about me negatively if i talked to them theyd probably be open to me people i meet daily that i think hate me dont hate me if they do theyre basing it off one encounter they dont know me and i shouldnt care when i walk my dog people who see me out in public dont know im unemployed and friendless or that my hair is really greasy no one but me has felt my pain or understands so screw it even if i have screwed up my reputation by being a recluse its so easy to change how people see you if you only have the courage to try theres no point in feeling guilt about sa we are going to find friends at some point or another our sa will die down eventually with personal growth or outside help we might as well be okay with our circumstances in the meantime i used to spend all my alone time so all the time feeling bad about it but whats the point that will only make me more bitter lets stop acting like having no friends is the worst thing in the world were not actually missing out on much maybe this realization will help us to stop trying too hard in social situations and messing up loneliness is painful but only because other people make it painful by reminding us how flawed we are i know its impossible to implement stop caring overnight but please try i hope other friendless people out there can get to the point in life where they dont care what others think because after years it has finally freed me tldr people make us feel shit for not having friends but realize if people didnt make us feel shit about ourselves wed probably be okay try and get to the point where you realize that its okay to be who you are and be happy alone stop comparing yourself to others and just stop caring what people think dont let peoples opinions of you drive your self esteem into the ground",2
outside my dad always has a horrible attitude ever since i was young ive always been the type to not really want to socialize id always spend most of the time i had alone and at home my dad has always been the person with a really shitty angry attitude over the smallest things hes worked on it over the years and hes improved however he still carries it since you cant really remove part of your already made personality during summer i usually stay at home and go outside as much unless theres a good movie i want to seeto the store with my parents i dont really have many friends in real life even though i talk to a few people at school i dont really like going out with them i prefer being on my own i have a few good friends online which is surprising im closer to them than classmates i normally voice call them daily and we play a few games together since were the same age and known each other in the friend group for a few years we all have the same interests in games and we met in our early childhood days of starting to play video games i am years of age and my dad always wants me to turn my computer off at pm when its left on past pm he usually gets really mad which i find stupid because its summer i know i shouldnt stay up to am which i dont want to i just want him to stop getting mad over stuff like that he normally says its because i spend a couple hours a day on it i go to the gym daily especially over summer i just dont know whats a good way i can maybe convince him that its maybe time for me to be able to control my own sleep schedule do you guys have any good ideas how i can accomplish this i had a therapist who told me i should stop being scared of my dad and be able to voice out my opinion and even my mom tells me that its just hard because his attitude makes it seem like hes going to get mad over me mentioning it,2
outside do some of you on here think that dependency on social media and the internet only made your social skills worse ive been unable to function normally in social situation since i was like i never made any friends or had any social skills but i also didnt have a computer or anything at home back then so i still played outside with my sisters and brother not with friends tho then when i was we moved house and got a computer at first i just played the normal kids games but when i was i started using sites like tumblr to express myself because i saw a lot of people on there who also had social anxiety or who were generally socially awkward i got validation through likes and comments on social media so i didnt really make an effort to put myself out there irl because i didnt want to risk the rejection irl looking back now though i realise that i shouldnt have depended on social media for my social interaction and i should have actually gone outside and tried to talk to people to build up my social skills now im fucked because im and have the social skills of an year old girl then again i dont know if i actually would have improved my social skills without social media because i might have stayed in my shell irl anyway idk does anyone relate to this,2
"outside, hiking, biking everyone hates me and what ive learned from it this is going to be a weird post and hopefully it fits here well i never thought of this as a social anxiety but it actually is kind of correct me if im wrong im new to reddit ive been hated even since preschool not by my family by all means and people liked members of my family by the way it seemed like people only outside of my family hated me strangers classmates coworkers anyone i came into contact with besides my family hates me i was always the quiet one and the weird one i never minded either i fed off of their hate anytime i got bullied i would fight back like you know when they say fight or flight yea i was the fighter i would lash out and do exactly what they did to me or i would cry and show them exactly how it made me feel right then and there almost as a joke but filled with rage i didnt really get embarrassed i was really good at doing embarrassing things and be okay with it most of the time i preferred to be alone i never liked it when people tried to become my friend like why are you texting me and calling me please leave me alone for some reason i did actually become friends with the other unliked kid i would see people snicker at them and see them as weird heres a little story there was one girl in middle school her name was jane she had long black hair pale skin and bright hazel eyes the kids were literally afraid of her and thought she was weird i wasnt afraid of her and i was fascinated in her i also felt empathy for her i could relate to her of being unliked end of short story weird part about enjoying being alone is ive always had a boyfriend since the beginning of high school the boyfriends were always cool and well liked by others the boyfriends were all similar in their own ways we all broke up mutually calmly and on good terms the boyfriends all gave me respect friendship and trust the cool boys always liked jane as well and she always had a cool boyfriend too other boys thought we were the funniest raddest coolest best to be around chicks out there or so they say so i guess what i should have said in the beginning of this entire post is most girls hate me so truth be told not everyone hates me this has been a lie for my whole life i believed as a small child up until early adulthood is that everyone hated me was far from the truth one day i had enough i tried to kill myself slit my wrists and wanted to bleed out well it didnt work i didnt die and i should have gotten stitches so i decided that day i will never try again left with awful scars i still hated my life and the fact everyone hated me i fell again in these ideas i created sure there was hard proof for people hating me they hated the way i looked the way i dressed my hair they spread rumors they prank phone called me tried to best me up i had a girl send me a page text message saying i lie about every story i ever told her the words this girl said to me hurt me deeply i cried and cried i worked with her and i had to face her i was terrified of her and i wondered why me it was a pattern some girls simply just didnt like me there was nothing i could say or do any differently you might be thinking there has got to be a reason why people hate me the only thing i can think of to answer that thought would be that i am totally myself i dont sugar coat shit im honest and i like to share ideas and past expieriances so here is a little description about me to paint a better picture i try hard with things i do i really enjoy practicing different skills and hobbies that strike my interest suddenly such as painting playing instruments gymnastics yoga hiking biking dog training cooking singing and more if something interests me i try it you could say im a go getter at the same time im laid back im quiet and a keep to myself person other times i am wacky and weird i sing and dance to myself i talk to myself i do weird things i make jokes and i laugh at things i am over the spectrum of things i am ever changing i am confused but i am aware i am always looking around me and thinking people are planning things i avoid people other times i truely care about people i love people and i love seeing their talents i want to get to know them and i listen to them i always see people and notice their intentions you could say i am observant but all of this i still enjoy being alone i guess i live a balanced life im also a libra and my life seems to match up to those horoscopes most of the time to also paint a picture of myself so instead of rambling on and on and on as im surprised if anyone is even still reading this im going to get straight to the point ive learned a lesson in life and it is difficult to grasp the lesson is no one actually truely cared about me all along but myself it was me all along that cared too much about what people thought it was my reactions towards situations that hurt me and made me think people hate me i have to come to terms that i am simply an imperfect human being with odd characteristics as everyone else we are all so unique and in our own little worlds we all work differently and thats how we all fit together just as a puzzle and how each piece is unique and all work together sometimes it takes a while for the pieces to come together and sometimes they seem to fit but they dont really work well and you cant actually fit them perfectly sometimes different pieces in the puzzle need to be as far away as possibly to work perfect and help complete the picture it is okay to not get along with everyone but when they show their dislike i need to keep calm and carry on what i mean by our own little worlds is everything around us is determined by our own judgements and the way we see things around us we all see things differently our brains work differently and you can clearly see we are all different so that proves our own little worlds we all automatically look out for our own well being so my whole life i was thinking too hard about what people thought of me once someone expressed their slight second care about me my reaction made me believe that everyone hated me it was a delusion i had a chain reaction because once i believed everyone hates me my actions and reactions more than likely changed that held characteristics that are easy to dislike by other people hopefully out of all of this rambling is that i can continue to realize these thoughts of mine and start to have a better attitude towards life i hope i can bring light and new helpful ideas to the world i strive to be the best i can for myself and others i will react to others even when they do me wrong as a calm and collected individual i will handle my fight instinct as a normal human in complete control i will continue to just be myself and let others be themselves",2
"walk, running i have realised that it is not just shyness and introversion i need help but im too afraid to ask for it im male suffer from gad since i was yo got diagnosed with it when i was or this past summer i saw many changes with my behaviour and thought they were normal because of puberty and such now im sure it isnt just puberty today i went to the store to buy a new pair of earbuds mine broke and listening to music helps with my anxiety i was on foot and during the mimute walk to the store i was starting to get sweaty i was thinking what to say to shop assistant and i was afraid of someone recognising me and i had to make a small talk with them i get to the store a big one inside a mall i get there and the first thing i see were the earbuds but they werent those that i wanted searched and couldnt find the earbuds that i wanted i wanted to get as quickly as possible so i grabbed one of those and headed towards the counter to buy them the shop assistant was talking to women and i was afraid of interrupting them i give the earbuds to another shop assistant that was next to the other shop assistant that was talking to the women he was doing something else but i put the earbuds on top of the counter without saying anything the guy saw that i wanted to buy the ear buds and gave them to the lady that was talking to the women the woman was slowlying writting on the keyboard with fingers and talking to the women during this i was sweating and shaking and i was looking at the store i saw the earbuds that i wanted on my right and i had missed them when i was first looking for the earbuds i take one of the earbuds and placed them on top of the counter the shop assistant didnt see the earbuds that i wanted on top of the counter i had to talk to the shop assistant that i wanted to change the product few words was quick and quiet while shaking and sweating she did what she had to do and i took the money out of my wallet shaking to give the lady i put them in my backpack and walk almost running to home thinking that i was way too akward and that they saw me shaking and sweating got home and started writting this i go the shrink about my gad but never mentioned my anxiety while on these situations im too afraid my parents judge me for not hangging out much with my peers they compare me to them when they were my age and i sometimes get grounded because they think that i am additcted to my pc and phone which i am not and that addiction is making me hang out less with my friends my shrink knows my parents really well she was my dads shrink for when he had depression it was on that time that i was diagnosed with gad at the end of each session my shrink talks to my dad or my mom about the session amd im afraid my parents will judge me after the session at home what should i do im pretty confident im socially anxious my best friend is the only one that knows about this",2
walk why am i so socially anxious despite not being anxious in general and having no reason to be socially anxious i have really bad social anxiety to the point of selective mutism ever since i entered preschool thanks to this i never made any friends growing up except my brother and now im without ever having had any kind of friend so i spend nearly all day at home everyday except when i go for a walk it also goes without saying that ive never done anything even remotely romantic with a girl but the weird thing is that i have good parents and they was never bullied even once growing up and during elementary middle and high school i just get anxious to the point of not saying anything whenever im out of my comfort zone this has always puzzled me im rarely anxious otherwise and ive even nearly died a few times because of my own stupidity lol but none of that made me feel very anxious at all unlike the prospect of socializing is this all genetic my parents and brother are normal as hell though i took a big personality test and as expected i scored low on generalizedanxiety th percentile but extremely high on selfconsciousnesssocial anxiety th percentile but why,2
pool i would say just think of a good excuse not to go in the pool you can still enjoy it from the side maybe say that you are feeling a little dizzy or that you burn easily,2
"outside, walk what is wrong with me ill try to keep this short im and i currently live in brooklyn ive been here my whole life with the exception of college speaking of college i have a bachelors degree in english i know i am currently unemployed and my last two jobs were in non profit academic advisory roles i was pretty much a loner and hated school throughout life i was taken to a therapist when i was and they declared i was normal i started questioning life in college and realized it was pretty useless and that it was school and work until you die i drank liquor i would say the normal amount for a college student after graduating i took the two advisory jobs which i hated both jobs due to anxiety i am not a people person in general and i would sweat profusely when talking to students or even in mildy hot temperatures i sweat x more than others even in the winter i would sweat in a crowded subway or platform or talking to new people i spoke to a doctor and i was prescribed robinul and told i had hyperhydrosis the robinul works so that part of my life is solved temporarily in addition to this no matter what allergy medicine i take or what dose i drip water from my nose and eyes if i go outside especially in the morning and its sunny or windy my eyes water i get acid reflux and heartburn from tomato sauce coffee and liquor all things i love i also find myself getting extremely angry at the simplest things people walking slow in the city etc to the point where i think about attacking someone in my head when i began feeling suicidal at my first job after graduation i spoke to a therapist again who once again told me i was normal a regular new yorker at this point i am at a wits end and speak to another doctor who prescribes me zoloft and other downers i mix them with alcohol in a excessive amounts to cope with the job i hate i stop taking the zoloft pretty because they didnt work for me i was taking to a hospital where people told me i was a handsome man who had things to live for and sat next to a girl with cut marks on her arm and a guy who wanted to start fires with his hands i did my research before hand and i realized that they would probably give me shock therapy i dont know how that would help so i pretended to feel better fast forward to today i am unemployed living off my parent i work out about three or four times a week i am about the only problem is i have little to no appetite daily and i am starting to develop a belly i eat maybe twice a day where i force myself to eati sweat like patrick ewing in the fourth quarter if i dont take robinul and i work out times a week so this is unexplainable to me anyway ive had ultrasounds endoscopy colonscopy and the gastro doctor stated i was in perfect health and the only theory he has is ibs as you can see ive had a long series of issues in my body and doctors telling me everything is fine and blah blah etc so im at a wits end i also have gynecomastia in both nipples and its another obstacle that is annoying to deal with im unemployed so i have no insurance to see any more doctors and i just think life is bullshit and i dont want to deal with it i have a girlfriend who helps me want to keep living although she keeps alluding to marriage in kids which im vehemently against the only people that stop me from slicing my wrists are her my mother aunt brother and or friends i spend my days applying for jobs jerking off and playing k in between the gym and my gf",2
outside my dad always made me feel really bad for not having friends or a social life my whole life my father has always been very critical on my social life as a kid he always gave me a hard time for not going outside and playing with other kids he would always ask me who do you talk to in school who do you hangout with in school why are you always by yourself you dont have any friends it even got to a point where he started forcing me to go outside to try to force me to play with the other kids that caused a lot of resentment even to this day he asks me are you making friends in college at work i understand his concern as a parent but i just think he put too much pressure on me to make friends and just made me feel bad for not being social enough i do feel like this has interfered with my ability to make friends i feel like i try too hard now and it backfires can you guys relate,2
outside finding something i enjoy would help the time pass but literally nothing in this world i enjoy and my sleeping disorder is so severe i have no energy to go outside and do anything id like a girlfriend but i dont know where to meet people i cant work or go to school besides no one would like me anyways im a nigger,2
beach yes i understand this problem i still have it but it doesnt affect me considerably anymore i somehow managed to suppress my anxiety its still there sometimes i feel it more that other times but in the meantime it became less of an obstacle even if i feel anxious af doesnt mean they can read my mind they dont know whats going on in my mind and even if even if it obviously shows theyll probably find it cute or appreciate my efforts or say to themselves wow this dude likes me so much that hes really trying its still there but it wont stop me most of the times sometimes from doing what i want to do and one of the best things happened to me when i suppressed my fears some stupid things happened as well but thats to be expected perhaps you dont necessarily want to approach girls at the beach you can do it wherever you want i do it when and where i feel to a certain degree comfortable and confident and make it look natural go to your natural habitat bookstore college library some coffee shop whatever and start a normal conversation what works for me is to look at what we have in common oh youre in that class well what do you think about that and that youre reading that too i read it too i was thinking about reading that i usually read stuff like that but i heard these are good what do you read and dont expect it to happen either you might go out and dont talk to any girl dont fore it but dont let the chance escape you either it must be natural if you really dont have anything to say to her then dont or if you feel lucky just say hey and ask for her number and then excuse yourself because you have to be somewhere or find some excuse by the law of large numbers sooner or later youre going to manage it,2
outside tips to build courage i want to meet new people to hang out with but the thought of talking to a strangers terrifies me its summer and i want to hang out outside instead of being home the whole summer,2

outside never im extremely socially awkward but i know some normal people shit to say i also know that its perfectly fine to not join a conversation even when youre in close proximity to others they probably did notice or care but if they noticed yeah theyre definitely still thinking about that weird fucker in the uber and you probably should never go outside again people dont care maybe you had a bad day and maybe these extroverts are regretting everything they said deep down and wishing they could be quiet like you,2
walk im just reaching breaking point now im so lonely ok so im a year old man who has never had a girlfriend been on a date kissed or even held hands and it makes me severely depressed all i want out of life is a soulmate everything else to me is secondary than to have someone to love and be loved in return im a quiet person i dont go out clubbing and drinking i quite frankly hate that the problem being i dont know where to meet girls my age i know even if i went out drinking clubbing i would not find the kind of person i would want to be around at all i know what kind of person i like quiet like me someone i can talk and laugh about anything with and just be myself and they can be themselves up until the last year i didnt really think about this i wasnt an adult i was more bothered with messing around with my friends and doing my uni work but now i feel really empty i know i just want a woman in my life ive missed opportunities where the right person came along in the last years to be with girls i liked because i didnt realize i liked them until it was too late and they had already found other guys like soulmates i know i was immature and didnt realise what was happening nowadays i know that wouldnt happen but both of these people are long gone from my life over the last year ive been constantly using tinder plenty of fish and okcupid but no results at all tinder is the least successful as i have only had matches ever its not my type of women anyway pof and okcupid have more of the right types of people on there but the thing is ill always message first times out of i will get no reply and mostly if i do they stop replying in like or messages and ive only had connections that i thought were going somewhere but all got to the point of me asking them on a date and then going through them just saying they werent ready even though id only suggest going for a walk in town or a cup of coffee and a chat i dont know what im doing wrong there i dont know where to meet the right kind of people in real life im a freelance animator and that isnt very social at all and my other job is part time in a pound shop in my home town i still live with my parents simply because i cannot afford to move out at all and i dont really meet people at work besides if i saw a girl i liked at work i would not know what to say im terrified of lookingsounding creepy so what happens is i just cant even make eye contact let alone say anything im not ugly im not an asshole i am nice to everyone i meet unless they are unpleasant to me in the first place i dont know what to do if this seems ranty and rambly its because it is im just sitting here crying typing this,2
sun sweet dreams till sun beams find you what a depressing line ive been listening to dream a little dream alot lately ive heard it covered by an array of singers but my favorite being doris days take on it i love the song but when i think of the sun beams i picture moonlight because i hate the sun to me the sun symbolizes socializing with people in the depressing daytime on another note ive noticed this for awhile now but im always the last one to talk to a person im never the one to stop talking to the other i know they say sa people stop talking to people because they feel there bothering them but thats not me i wont bother somebody but ill give them opportunities to reply back and theyll reply with yeah oh or not at all i just felt like making a post to vent i guess id say ive been depressed lately but idk why i use the word lately im always depressed just sometimes more then other times i dont have a single friend online or off i guess i just wish i could hold on to one person who i didnt feel i was a complete burden to,2
outside i go out to the city alone sure it feels a bit awkward when youre there not smiling just kind of derping and you see literally everyone being with a group of friends or couples having fun singing laughing and if anyone in their joyous mood would approach you you despise the fake smile you must utter to fit in i know i cried on my way back home two years ago when i did that the first time last time i was just derp this yeari dont know ill go take pics and just wont care hopefully hey at least im outside eh better alone among people than alone in solitude,2
"running, walk, park realising i have social anxiety i never thought about it just simply presumed i was awkward as a child and now as a year old with no friends running around the campus trying to find an empty lecture hall to eat my lunch i am starting to realise that that is not normal behavior it is all of the small things from walking in the shade to hide myself from others to arriving minutes before a lecture to get a corner seat in the back row and to even having a fight with my partner because i didnt want to buy a yellow football as i didnt want people to stare at me at the park there are so many small things that i do that i realise are not normal they stress me out as i am always rushing to be a step ahead of other people to avoid conversation or stalling but i would rather be in a rush to have my cash and card ready at the cashier than have to make awkward eye contact how do other people come to the realisation that they have social anxiety and do i even have social anxiety or am i just a weird anxious person",2
walk i dated a girl almost years ago and at the time i didnt know how to call the way i am didnt know the term social anxiety before the first date i told her to remind me to ask her a question at the end of the date after we had a coffee and talked for like min min were awkward silent we went for a walk and i told her i have a problem to look into peoples eyes and i want to know if she noticed she said yes and a moment before i felt shame she told me she has hard time looking into peoples eyes either we also talked about the fact that i hate awkward silent and it make me nervous she said she actually like the silent and from that moment i didnt really felt awkward when there was silent we dated for one more time and then we splitted up because this wasnt a match but she was a good girl and a good first person to date,2

"hikes, walk i want to add that for me theres several tiers of traveling activities from least fun to most fun going on guided tours its usually so boring for me i would never do this again shopping and eating at famous restaurants problem is that its hard to keep going while carrying all that stuff and sitting down to eat takes too much time that could be spent on more interesting activities going on hikes and visit famous attractions might be a let down when you actually see those places but at least now you know what people were raving about just walk around randomly for a day off the beaten path and take breaks at coffee shops at night go to bars and clubs and talk to strangers what better way to learn about another culture than a first hand experience of talking to locals of course this is very scary as someone with sa but i would like to do this eventually because the other stuff is starting to bore me",2
"running, run oh i wasnt in anyway implying my running fast was a good thing for me its totally not for example you said that person noticing you lapping them that would make me extremely anxious the whole point is i want to be noticed as little as possible or not at all invisible my teachers and everyone in my class when i was younger and in school would call me a jackrabbit as a compliment and gather to watch me run i fucking hated the attention",2
outside im rather new here this is a bit brief but bare with me i guess i am looking for some help i have trouble with conversating with people i am and male just recently i have been trying to invite myself into a group of a few children they seem to welcome me everytime i say hello sitstand in the group but i dont say anything else whilst they are talking away i cant think of a word to say i struggle to even keep track of what people are talking about i find speaking with adults hard but a lot easier i may sound stuck up saying this but i find almost all children my age immature most of their jokes i dont find funny and i am not interested in their childish conversations most of them are around years old when i tell most people i am they are very suprised ive had a few people over the internet guess im by the sound of my voice when someone asks me in person they ussually thought i was around i almost find it to be a chore to even join a group of kids my age im very interested in history and science i could talk anout black holes all day unfortunately those sort of things dont seem to interest them nor do they even seem to understand it i havent had an actual freind since the rd grade im about to be in th it sounds like an exaggeration but most days i am stuck in the shitty apartment doing nothing but watching youtube all day my parents would rather not let me outside because boy your gonna get raped and they gonna chop ur dic off yea im sure i have tried reaching out to my parents for help but they tell me its fine living like shit without ever talking to somebody or doing anything at all is not fine when i say i cant do anything im being honest i honestly spend the entire day watching youtube because i cant do anything else i just need help learning to talk to people i see some of them griping about how they wanted to kill themselves because they had to spend a whole day inside the house boo hoo little bitch try spending every day like that i cant relate to any children my age i dont play any video games or watch any shows and i dont use social media as i have no reason to i go to an online home school which does not help my case the children i try to talk to are ussually from church any help would be great,2
soccer eh kinda sorta not really even though i played for many different teams and with many different ppl i was able to play soccer for years was able to go to college i have been able to travel to a lot of places the only thing that social anxiety impacts for me is my ability to connect with people face to face and actually have words come out not nearly silent puffs of air in which i say an entire paragraph in one breath and find myself out of breath i just dont like being around people but that doesnt mean i lik experiences,2
camp i had the same problem i remember when i first went to college i had no friends and i saw a guy i recognized from a camp sitting in the lunch room i went and sat with him and his friends but i locked up and didnt say anything i still shudder when i think of how awkward i was that summer i worked at a fast food restaurant whenever i was on the register i would talk to the customers that was excellent practice if i didnt feel like talking i could just stick to the script would you like fries with that if i did feel like talking id chat for a bit while taking there order i noticed that customers liked talking to me and that helped my confidence in talking when school started back up i finally started talking to whoever i sat next to not because i had to but because i wanted to tldr the only cure is practice and youve listened in on so many conversations that subconsciously your probably an expert in conversations and youve just gotta learn how to apply what youve observed,2

"soccer, walk anxiety with girls for background im a yearold male and ive had pretty severe social anxiety for my entire postadolescent existence im back in college now for the first time in a year and a half after taking time off to treat anxiety depression and substance use and absolutely nothing has changed im feeling so hopeless what gives me more anxiety than anything though is talking to girls i just cant imagine initiating or taking a lead in any situation with a girl the only real girlfriend ive had the night we first got together we were sitting alone and i knew she wanted me to kiss her it was painfully obvious but i couldnt even do it she had to text me after i left saying you shouldve kissed me i had to leave her to go back to school and i honestly believe unless something changes ill never be with anyone satisfying again ive actually been with a decent number of girls but mostly just off tinder and often much less attractive than me i have a super high sex drive though and a real burning desire for intimacy of all kinds but i feel completely powerless because i dont think ill ever be able to approach a girl in any way so anyway tonight i was watching a soccer game at my school and ended up sitting next to this absolutely beautiful girl like stunning and i didnt even feel like she was out of my league like i often do she was just perfectly my type the whole time im sitting there im thinking just say something to her anything anything but of course i couldnt do it when i walked home i felt like killing myself it makes me feel hopeless and emasculated and i dont know what to do just had to get that off my chest i dont have anyone i can even talk to about this",2
"walk, running i dont have any advice sorry i just wanted to thank you for this post after reading about it again i think i might have it too the funny thing is that ive already thought i had it around five years ago but i was hesitant and still am because personality disorder sounds like a whole other league than only anxiety but the description of it fits me perfectly and much more than sa i fit all the criteria from both icd and dsm for avpd just a few days ago i wondered why something like extreme selfconsciousness wasnt classified as a disorder what i think is one of the biggest differences is that i usually dont feel actual fearpanic with shivering fast heartbeat sweating etc ive only had one panic attack so far and it wasnt during a social setting im very tense in public but i wouldnt call it afraid like you im estranged to my whole family and i even had a close friend who i suddenly couldnt talk to normally anymore like she was a stranger but she really wasnt i became suicidal when i was told at an involuntary internship that i smiled too little and that people complained about me because of it i get wasted on days i feel like people dislike me like when coworkers dont sit down next to me at work or ignore me when i ask a question and after trying to unsuccessfully socialise at work for a week i fell back into my colddistant self and do awkward stuff like walking meters behind my coworkers on my way to work instead of running up to them because i dont want to annoy them or get the feeling theyre annoyed by me i dont know maybe i do have sa and not avpd after all i think avpd describes me way better but the two disorders are so similar its a bit confusing i should bring it up with my therapist",2
"coast, camp, outside should i talk to her this is going to be a long story as there is a lot of backstorycontext needed to understand those who are meant to read this and offer guidance will i hope no idea how to cut it down into a tldr as it is far too lengthy ill try to keep this first backstory as short and to the point as possible im live in australia on the east coast grew up in sydney and lived there until i was i have a sister who is years older who still lives in our hometown lost my father at a young age at ive been battling depression for over years since i was i moved hours away from my hometown at and my depression got much worse i stopped seeing friends stopped going out stopped talking to my friendsfamily which led to dealing with anxiety issues which led to social anxiety due to isolating myself among other symptoms ive recently started seeing a psychologist getting out of the house more im finally starting to feel like going out and doing things i want to meet people ive been out moredone more in january of this year than i have the past years finally starting to feel normal i still havent reconnected with any of my old friends i havent posted anything on my personal social media accounts facebookinstagramsnapchat since i first moved in late havent spoken to any friends since then and havent seen them either some have reached out to me but i never replied havent had a job since i moved up here either for some reason im still afraid to reach out to them because i know that will lead to eventually meeting up with them in person im even afraid to post anything on social media from fear of them reaching out to me because i know this will lead down the same route i havent made any new friends since moving from my hometown havent worked or studied and basically feel like a complete failure afraid of what they will say think or feel about me cos i have no life per say i have already made a post looking for adviceguidance regarding the issue related to my old friends however the above context was necessary to lead onto my next story which i am solely looking for adviceguidance for new years eve i went to a house party with my older sister cos i had nothing else to do literally and met all her friends etc people were drinking majority of people were on drugs mdma lsd and ketamine was available i hadnt had drugs for years since australia day in when i was i didnt plan on taking anything i met a girl who lived there friend of my sisters whos my age lets call her mary i was told by a few people she thought i was attractive and wanted to hookup i havent hooked up with anyone for over years and i actually was thinking that about her anyway so i was keen i was drinking a lot when i first got there because of my anxiety meeting new people etc and ended up having to stop drinking because i was getting sick mixing it with weed only drank times last year so i had a very low tolerance a few hours later i was in marys room with her my sister and another girl who lived there just talking lets call her barbara barbara asked if we all wanted to get any more mdma caps her bf had stuff people could buy during the night all of them had already taken an mdma cap each earlier on in the night and they all said yeah to having another one which left me to decide i ended up asking for one since i felt comfortable didnt feel pressured by them and the moment felt right to do it granted my judgement was way off cause i was drinkingsmoking not the best idea to jump on drugs with people you barely know but i felt safe being with my sister so i took mine with them and they left me and mary in the room not long after started talking to mary getting to know her and all that basically having a d andm she was telling me that she is going overseas this year to a us summer camp for weeks i felt so unaccomplished and like a loser basically because theres no way i could do that i told her shes really ambitious and we started talking about other things while smoking weed together we ended up hooking up for awhile kissed at midnight and started talking more after that at one point while we were outside having a cigarette she asked me to tell her my life story it caught me off guard cos if im honest i dont even know what it is i got about halfway through and somehow we got interrupted and i never got to hear hers or finish mine i realised i was saying a lot of bad things that had happened in my life rather than who i am and what i do anyway mary and barbara decided to come back with me my sister and her partner back to their place about an hour or two after midnight to spend the rest of the night together they were all going to take a tab of lsd each when we got back i didnt want to have psychedelics so i had a second mdma cap when we got back to my sisters place mary and barbara lost an acid tab when we got there eventually we all gave up looking for it and they all took a tab each not long after taking the tab it got kinda weird with her her vibe changed and she wasnt talking much we werent as close physically as earlier not cuddling n stuff but we were holding hands they were all waiting for the lsd to kick in and everyone wasnt really talking much and cos i hadnt taken a tab i wasnt on the same level i think thats where things changed cos my nd mdma cap was coming on while her tab was coming on so we were on different wavelengths we were all chilling in the lounge room laying down for about an hour and it was pretty obvious barbara was the th wheel mary her friend and my sister went into her room and were talking for awhile eventually they came out and we all went for a cigarette on the balcony and they basically came and said they were leaving they were going to stay the night then an hour or two later after we got back they said they were leaving cos her friend wanted to be with her boyfriend i was too out of it to leave the unit and when i said im too fcked to leave when mary asked me if i was coming she said well your ambitious never has my gut dropped so much instant regret such a horrible feeling intensified by the drugs im sure they left cos they started feeling uncomfortable being there particularly marys friend being the th wheel without her bf on new years eve my sister her partner and i all planned on coming back to their placed to end the night there regardless a safe place to come back to so we kind of all had it in our head that we werent leaving after we got back looking back i wish i went back with mary and her friend but it probably wasnt the best idea because they ended up taking another tab and daytripped which could have ended up quite messy since it was pretty messy after they left anyway just being with my sister n her partner who knows what would happened i never will know cos i chose not to go i told my sister n her partner the next morning what mary said when she left and i asked them if i screwed up by not going back with her my sisters husband said yeah i thought i heard her say something like that but my sister sort of dismissed it they were both pretty adamant that i hadnt fucked up though the next day my sister said she spoke to mary on fb and asked her about what she said before she left that night and she said that she didnt say that at all something like oh alright then was what she apparently said but i didnt really believe it mary sent me a message first on snapchat a couple days after new years basically saying hey was nice to meet you had a nice time and we said we should chill n have a sesh sometime etc so we started talking a little bit went to buy weed from their place a day later and added her on fb but didnt ask for her number such an idiot anyway it was my sisters birthday the first week of and she had a party the first weekend th jan saturday mary and i were both going so we were going to catch up there i was talking to her leading up to my sisters bday party after i came home on the thursday and then the next night i had a panic attack after smoking some weed happened cos of repressed emotions from traumatic domestic event in late and went to the doctor the next morning for a referral to a psychologist along with some sort of temporary medication to help me sleep and i havent spoken to her since and with all my anxiety im afraid to even talk to her because its been over a month and she probably thinks im a rude douchebag but then again she may not even think twice about it my sister said she knows i have a lot going on in my life at the moment so she probably doesnt mind i felt like i got attached to her way too quickly after that night or perhaps attached to the idea of potentially being with someone since it had been so long since ive actually had that physical connection with someone it was quite difficult to just let go and forget about it i became afraid of this attachment and decided to stop talking to her to detach myself i didnt want to come across as needy or obsessive couldnt stop thinking about her for weeks afterwards avoiding talking to her ended up making me think of her more she hasnt messaged me since i didnt reply to her last message so as far as shes concerned she may not even think about me at all when i was younger i used to talk to girls day and night not exactly proud of it but my point is i had confidence i wasnt anxious or insecure like im too afraid to even message mary i just feel awkward after hooking up with her when i went to her place and added her on fb i was so awkward around her didnt know how to act around her after hooking up and being so fcked from the drugs lol i just want to be able to talk to her and get to know her and i dont really feel like getting to know her through text is how i want to do it either id rather do it in person but then im awkward in person after hooking up lol dont how to be dont know what to do she keeps popping in my head feel like im not worthy enough not enough self worth and confidence no job no car no license no friends what do i have to offer i lift weights im fit im healthy im intelligent im educated own my own business i feel like im attractive definitely not ugly but can barely bring myself to message her on facebook am i just mentally stuck on this whole thing do i need to let it go and move on i know the next move would be to reach out to her again and eventually ask to meet up in person and go from there but my social anxiety is stopping me i feel like there is a lot that has gone unsaid between us that should be spoken about and idk if thats me overthinking it but i dont even know how to bring that up to her either i feel so weird thinking all of this when i barely know her i just dont know what to do or how to ask her how she feels about the whole thing cos apparently she got out of a year long relationship herself and according to my sister she probably isnt looking for anything so as far as mary is concerned it may have just been a one time thing to hook up on new years i dont know her well enough to make that judgement and dont feel comfortable enough to talk to my sister about it anymore cos i told her about getting attached and she made me feel like a complete idiot for being like that idk if it was because i was on mdma i know it dissolves boundaries and you generally have a better connection with other people the love drug very euphoric but i was drawn to her in a way i have never experienced before before taking the mdma normally im sexually attracted to girls like yeah i find her attractive but thats not what drew me too her idk how to explain it like a deeper connection i dont want to say like a soul mate but ive never felt a connection like this with a person before but then again it could be a superficial connection with the drugs i really have no idea any opinionsadviceguidance would seriously be appreciated so much i have no one to talk to about this i got about a way through the story with my psychologist in todays session and its just eating me up inside i want to get out of this mental rut thank you in advance lt",2
soccer what a loser rofl that comes to mind i havent talked to him since when i was th grade and we studied in the same school he was mostly poor student but he knew what he wanted to do even then i feel intimidated by him because he was kind of bully in school now he must be changed because its y ago but the memory stays we were some kind of rivals in school because both of us were good at soccer i was the nerd d we were the captains of the team of our class always competed against each other on the field,2
outside i think you need a hobby i would recommend skydiving thats what i do and i love it if i had a year left i dont think i would live any differently i would leave work for sure and focus on myself for that year but i dont think i would do anything extreme i would probably just skydive until i couldnt afford it anymore i would also just chill outside a lot and probably do mushroomslsd what i think you should do is really think about how fortunate you are sure you have some issues but so does everyone else it might be cliche but think about children in third world countries i mean really think and try and imagine how their lives are they dont have the outlets that we do to express their issues they live with them every day a lot of them dont have access to fresh water or a consistent supply of food children starve to death until that perspective really hits you it might not have as much of an impact as it does for me,2
outside and useless my story of social anxiety i used to be that funny guy in class in elementary and middle school i was always the guy that tried to make everyone laugh but made a fool of myself looking back now i realized at a young age i was scared to talk to girls in the rd grade i had a psp that i would go on facebook with and just try to socialize on there every year i spent locked up in my room just watching videos on youtube playing xbox and barely socializing i never had a girlfriend but always talked to girls over twitter and instagram i graduated high school with a gpa and didnt learn a damn thing im going to be starting my nd semester at a community college but have no desire to go i have no passion or goals for my future im not working because i am literally not good at anything and am terrified to socialize with people dont get my wrong i have two great loving parents and two younger sisters i feel horrible because my younger sisters look up to me and im a horrible role model i hate school so much but what else am i going to do with my life then im starting to lose my two closest friends because i never want to leave my house my mom practically does everything for me whenever i do go outside i have the ugliest look on my face because i just hate my life i was prescribed an antidepressant but didnt take it because im afraid of the side effects i often think about suicide by overdosing on the pills but that would just crush my family and put them in serious debt with the cost of my funeral i just wish there was just a reset button so i could live a completely different life i feel so alone and see nothing for my future,2
"swimming, walk, biking managed to befriend someone but when we hang out a part of me is just waiting until its over friendship as a loner so i go to this placelets just say place once or twice a week and i see this guy there about once a week i a guy had a little crush on him its good to note that im in my s hes years older than me and i am in no way shape or form out to anyone when i found out he likes women my little crush subsided a bit not completely though but a few stuff makes me pretty sure hes not bi either just wondering what his thoughts on gay people are recently found out he goes to church but unsure how religious he is could be partially to meet people and practice the language im a loner introvert whathaveyou a person who is or prefers to be alone especially one who avoids the company of others the type of guy who dosent have good social skills no confidence and jealous traits known as the boring guy the friendless guy the invisible man after a few weeks of seeing him every now and then he gave me his number and told me to call him if i wanted to do something like go swimming i was anxious for days but ended up texting him he had other plans i was a bit proud of myself for actually texting and relieved i didnt have to hang out with someone im the kind of person that just waits for things to happen to me i follow the flow because im socially anxious and depressed i have no ambitions or future plans or aspirations or anything i just wait for things to happen i dont initiate note i dont really like this about myself but yah next time i met him we talked he bought us both an icecream each and suggested swimming again when in the moment like that i feel like i should say yes that its probably goodbetter to actually socialise with someone so i said yes weve gone swimming two days in a row now and afterwards we go pick some berries its been ok ive felt dumb cus i didnt know the answer to some things i felt boring and awkward because i didnt have a reply for most things like talk about cars and im like uh yeah mhm i dont know how hes not bored of me but he asked if i wanted to go swimming again if he asks a question like a or b i just dont know you choose you wanna keep swimming or should we get out uh sure lets get out im just following along even though its been nice i guess i kinda feel like im waiting for it to be over waiting for me to go home at the same time i enjoy his company it feels wrong to feel like this like this isnt how normal people are supposed to feel like i was slightly bored when we were picking berries and its like ahh im alone nice thats kinda nice but im bored a little im a walking indecisive contradicting blob at least the biking and swimming is some exercise i could lose some weight",2
outside you are not alone i use to do the same thing too when i was younger i always looked at the floor because i was scared of people thinking i was looking at them and also scared that they were judging me my parents forced me to always pick my head up because they said people pick on you when your head is down because thats a sign of weakness lack of confidence and depression thanks parents that clearly didnt help my anxiety lol now i just have resting bitch face lol could also be that i am a new yorker and we always look grumpy lol i also developed perfectionism i always have to make sure i look perfect in case people look and judge me to ease my anxiety my best tactic is that i listen to music really loud when im outside allowing me to enter my own world drown out everything around me sometimes i day dream while looking at peoples direction so my head is up then when im at work i learned this online somewhere on public speaking i look directly at peoples noses to appear as if im making eye contact hope this helps,2
outside anytime darlin im similar to you in that i dont watch sports dont really go on dates rarely asked and i dont drink very often and you are rightbeing asked why is awkward and kind of annoying perhaps we relate though in our reasons i feel like its both for me i often dont know what to do outside and sometimes even if i do know what to do i have anxiety most of it now is that i dont have anyone to do those things with venturing out isnt fun for someone like me if im alone my anxiety tends to increase as i probably have a slightly dependent personality i actually am willing to go out now and even join in with a group of people for a sports game or whatever it might bebut i cant seem to find the group to do it withwithout going by myself firstwhich i dont want to doits kind of a never ending cycling id have to figure out the point that i can break it and then actually proceed to do so what about for you would you say its both,2
"run, pool thank you a lot really im actually a bit chubby and one of the reasons why im scared of the gym is because other kids from my school go there so right now im starting to run on a treadmill that i have at my house and i have lbs dumbbells which i heard wont do much but oh well i also have a punching bag and a pool on the addadhd i never really thought about that and i dont think i have it i do pay attention in school or so my grades say however i do have trouble with procrastination because its hard for me to get motivated i can watch a hour movie without being distracted once so i dont think i have addadhd but thank you for bringing it up because my mom actually does have adhd",2

outside i stopped trying to hide my insecurities but way back when i was in school i used to wear a hoodie in any weather it could be degrees outside and i refused to take the hoodie off i didnt want people to see my skinny arms,2
camp wow thats super inspiring i really struggle with this because i feel always judged by groups in those kind of situations where im supposed to be social im usually ok with being on my own but in my summer camp situation i cant stand being alone especially on day trips do you have any tips for overcoming this fear of judgement and start wandering on my own how did you overcome your thoughts that would be super useful for me to know since im trying to be more independent and be more on my own,2
outside i did it i managed to do two things that i was really anxious about firstly i made a post hereabout being nervous to contact and old friend i pushed myself to do it and it went really well she was super friendly and weve been chatting back and forth for the past few days i was also anxiousabout collecting donations for an organisation i volunteer for i just got back from doing it and im pretty proud of myself we were outside a supermarket so there were lots of people coming and going we managed to collect a good amount of money and i managed to make small talk and thank everyone who donated it sounds small but this was a huge step for me i was so anxious about these things but i managed to push through it and do them anyway feels great to have a win over my anxiety,2
jogging m and extremely fearful for my future hey reddit these last two weeks have been utter hell for me my th birthday was two weeks ago from tomorrow and i celebrated it without anyone close to me it was at that moment that i realized i needed to step up and actively combat my anxiety for my life to have any chance of improving still i have a few fears i only have one close friend irl at the moment and therefore i joined two meetup groups in an attempt to establish better connections ostensibly im a nerd and a gamer but i fear that my potential new friends will judge me for not getting to play many games growing up and will think im practically an old man for my age im starting to date via apps such as okcupid and did manage to secure one im scared my dates will judge me for having relatively little sexual experience ive only had sex a few times im also scared they will judge me for my living situation more on that below i live with my parents still since my line of work is hard to break into writing i did secure an internship from home recently which has the potential to move into full time work im terrified that a potential partner will judge me for this ive come to the realization this last year that im fairly happy with only a close friend or two yet i believe even an introvert should get out of the house semiregularly can i balance both the loner and involved lifestyles im trying to lose a lot of weight and so far have succeeded i cut out all junk food soda alcohol and fried foods and dont eat meat three days a week i exercise by jogging miles a day ive reentered therapy since its extremely beneficial to my wellbeing am i too old to gain a decent social life partner and job i mentally feel like a teenager rather than a year old man and fear that i cant make up for lost time my only choice is to try now to secure a possibly better future yet i fear ill fail in spite of my efforts any success stories,2
walk right after college i totally freaked out i couldnt even make the minute walk to the corner grocery store i stayed in my apartment for weeks and weeks at a time i couldnt make phone calls or answer the phone i gained probably or pounds i would just play the sims all day long hours and hours eat watch tv and take many naps i was just done i eventually went and got some therapy mostly cbt and it helped a lot i have two kids a house my husband a job and can pretty much force myself to get through things like work meetings and teaching things to coworkers now its still hard and i know im one of the office weirdos but im in a way better place than i used to be,2

outside relatable everytime i wanna go outside first i check if any neighbours are around to avoid awkward small talk i have probably missed my bus to school a couple of times lol,2
outside somehow i dont even want to get outside or talk to people i dont get anything positive from interacting with others and after all those negatives experiences i feel like im better off alone,2
camp yeah that camp felt like being stuck with a group of annoying people in the middle of nowhere but i think i might try giving therapy another shot with a good person one on one they might have something to offer and shit what do i have to lose besides thanks for your concern,2
outside at least you got some peace and quiet i couldnt go outside since its lately and only getting hotter,2
outside disturbed view of life im not sure this is the best place to ask this because its more of a psicological loop then anything else but it brings me to having problems in social life and life in general so here we go in the last yearsafter i finished high school i went in autopilot mode and just work come home play some videogames sleep rinse and repeat i start thinking about meaning of life in a disturbed way what if the earth wouldnt exist or the entire universe or if nothing existed at all if tomorrow every human being dies whats matter so this bring me to think about suicide but not in a depressed way like omg my life is so hard no one likes me etc rather if living has no purpose what difference in this universe will have me killing my self and my asnwer is evrytime there wouldnt make a difference with this being said i want to say that i dont want to commit suicide im just thinking of it as an action that have the same purpose of living no one for trying escaping this situation i started going to the gym and going to university someday happens that someone call me to go outside at the club or playing football but i costantly think about that what im doing has no meaning im just fulfilling a biological need even if tomorrow aliens come here and say that they created us for a given reason i wouldnt change my mind there is no difference accomplish that reason or not doing it so im wondering why even bothering going to university and leave my dad business letting him alone to that fricking heavy job and see him coming home everyday more and more tired i dont want this to happen because i will be very sad even if he says that he can find another employee but knowing the job he will go insane teaching to another person or just doing it alone like when i was a kid but i keep imaging him being alone all that time i start crying for no f reason basically this two topics my nihilistic view and my role in my dads job converge to the decision should i lose all the universityanother job experience and keep this autopilot mode for another years untill he retire with the chance of never get friends and a gf just for the sake of avoiding feeling bad for him i like the job btw but at the moment it prevent me of finding others thing i want but why bothering finding them in the first place what the difference if i die alone or i get married and have a family i know this wall of text is confused but i hope someone of you can help me,2
park i asked a girl out for the first time today i turned today and decided it was finally time to just go for it and ask somebody out since ive never even tried before my therapist has been telling me that i need to work on getting over my fear of rejection and to try asking out random girls with the goal of getting rejected so i went up to a cute girl in a park started chitchatting and just as i was leaving i asked if she wanted to go on a date with me my hands were shaking so bad and i could barely speak but i got her number and were going out this week,2
"walk, outside for me my smartphone helped a lot i would just set it up or hold it while walking outside and tell it about all the thoughts in my head i have concluded for myself it is not something bad just a lesser form of socializing with oneself in essence it is still the same conveying a message by spoken words so i dont find it weird",2
outside hate it when my parents assume that im doing something because of my anxiety rant im in my midtwenties and have gotten a pretty good handle on my anxiety i know when my anxiety is influencing my decisions and i am pretty good at putting at pushing through it it instantly sets me off when one of my parents assumes that i made a certain decision because of my anxiety a couple of weeks ago i was standing outside with a guy ive been dating and i was going to invite him in but i didnt want to embarrass my mother if she was in her pjs so i didnt i came inside after he left and repeated the same series of events to my mom and she goes why didnt you text me i stood there and in my head i said yeah that would have been the smart thing to do but i honestly didnt think of it i told her that i just didnt think of that but she though i didnt do it because of my anxiety this is one of those times that im sure that i was just an idiot and didnt think of doing that it just really bothers me when they immediately assume that and try to argue with me about it,2
"walk, jog usually just gaming drawing reading stuff on the internet taking the dog out for a walk and occasionally going for a jog",2

outdoors theres a hundred things i could share with you here but if you feel you have no purpose it can be valuable to try and take some time and map out a few things expectations the ones you have for yourself and the ones you think others have for you are there any that make you go i should want this but im not sure if i actually do values that you have for yourself what kind of things in life really make a difference for you in an ideal world with no expectations what kind of person would you want to be known as core talents what sort of games would you play what sort of activities would you do all by yourself unprompted when you were a very young child think four five maybe six years old before you had much awareness of what others wanted examining these things in more detail can give you a clue on what kinds of things give you energy what sort of tricky things you love to do that not everyone else might enjoy just as much did you love reading books fiction or factual did you ever act our stories with your toys did you ever step up and teach the other kids a new game did you like board games or solo puzzle games did you like exploring outdoors things like that anything you really did not like too,2
"park, outside maybe this is just my anxiety talking but whats so good about going out and im talking more about going out alone to places like a park fast food or a restaurantbar club etc a cinema can be good even alone but outside of that i think is pretty boring going out alone and since i dont have friends that makes me go outside something rare do you guys like to go out which places",2

"beach, outside i have no friends and i feel lonely post is going to be long and thank you to anyone who actually reads all of it okay so im f and i have no friends in high school i had really close friends including my main best friend lets call her bff and a bunch of other friends mainly just people i talked to and hung with in school and class but was never truly close with so my bff and i were super close all of high school until about the end of march when she basically ditched me for a new group of friends she made we would still talk and i was her best friend but once she started hanging out with her new friend group she never included me stopped telling me about important thing going on in her life etc and overall just acting really snobby and conceited i ended up confessing to one of the other girls i was really close with what was happening and she was by my side and supported me my bff and i ended up talking everything through and were good but things didnt really change she kept hanging out with them at all times never including me and when i did hang with them once she barely spoke to me the entire time after we graduated she had two weeks in our city before she had to go away and start summer semester at a college far away but still in the same state she spent the whole two with her new friend group and only gave me one day to hang out days before she had to leave during this time i was at my dads house and was so pissed that she would do this to me that i was not going to leave my dads house just so she could see me when she had all this time to and didnt summer goes along and we didnt talk not even once at this point in my life i had decided to start school in the spring to give myself some time because i felt that i needed it and my only two friends were the girl that helped me out with my bff and her best friend who was also my friend the entire summer we barely hung out after summer we hung out a couple times but they were all super boring im personally very outgoing and a hyped up type of person when im around people i feel comfortable with they would just sit there and not want to do anything fun or engaging i dont mean get drunk and party all night but like go makeup shopping or play fun stupid games go out to eat talk about boys go shopping go to the beach or in general anything besides like going to one of their houses and playing nintendo wii plus on top off all this they were very judgy and would look at me weird for saying something outside of the box when i would ask one of them about the boys in the college i was going to go to in the spring she would be dry and uninterested then in october i got a job and i really like the place i work at when we would hang out and i would try to tell them about the people and like the tea going on at work they didnt care and i would talk and they didnt respond and i felt like i was talking to my self all of this plus the fact that since they were each others best friend they wouldnt include me in a lot of their convos and then bring up things when i was there made me feel really lonely and tired eventually was broke the camels back was that drama basically started again with my bff and when i texted them i was just going to text her and end this once and for all they both started sending messages like oooohhh cant wait for the tea or the tea it hot and in general things like that i was so offended because instead of being there for me and supporting me bc they both knew how hurt and emotionally affected i was from the situation between my bff and i all they cared about was the tea and the drama a month after this happened i cut them off but only talked to one of them it was the one that helped me in the beginning with my bff i thanked her for supporting and that i was always going to be grateful for that but that our friend ship was over and i explained to her how they made me feel and basically she texted me back cursing me out and saying a whole bunch of rude shit and i never texted her again both of them blocked me on all social media platforms and i have not seen heard or talked to them since that day i started college but online bc i have no transportation to campus so i have no interactions with people my own age and at my job its mainly middle aged women and a few young people but not anyone i consider to have a good connection friendship wise with it gets me so sad to see my ex bff on social media going to parties and having fun making friends etc when i wish i was doing that plus just in general watching young people my age having fun and hanging out with their squad makes me depressed because i want that now because of my friendless life and because i have little to no interaction with people my own age in over a year im beyond scared to do school on campus so ive decided to do all of college online ive definitely gotten a lot anxiety in regards to being social with people my own age and also boys ive never had a boyfriend or even talked to anyone and with my whole lonely no friends no social life situation im never going to meet one and if i do i mentally ive already sabotaged myself because i think to myself how embarrassing it would be to meet a boy and when he asks about my friend me tell him that i have none like how fucking embarrassing and lame does that sound so to avoid this im just not gonna let any potential guy get close enough plus im insecure about my body bc im a little chubby but dont do anything to change this because i have zero motivation so far the only good things going for me are my job school and my immediate family i get depressed when i think about the fact that im so young and i have no friends anyone to hangout with and have normal social

biking so you really think that even with acute acne and so much scars on my skin from the acne isnt repulsive ive been trying to get that off me for more than years now im m and its still there i tried like different creams with no visible change some of them even made it a bit worse i even consulted a dermathologist who prescribed me strong pills against that however one side effect from that which i wasnt aware of but my parent were was depressio and eventually suicidal thoughts which happenned when i was around and its not like im ugly id be considering myself handsome if it wasnt for all of this but i just consider myself meh i mean nowadays its mostly scars but i still have a bunch of red markings everywhere on my cheaks neck shoulders back chest which look like i have a lot of acne all that since the skin in the scars is so thin that you can see the red of my blood more easily but most women around my age probably think im disgusting and unclean because of all that and thats not the case i take showers a day brush my teeth after every meal when i get the chance to so im clean and smell good and my teeth are white my hair looks clean i shave as for my shape i look fit even though i dont exercise except this weekend and yesterday where i started biking again to get myself in a better shape im not thin and i dont look chubby i look healthy its just the freaking scars and acne which probably looks disgusting i would imagine i would repulse girls just for that single fucking problem and thats probably why i have never been in a relationship gotten laid nor even gotten my first kiss and its not that i have a bad personnality either the few girls i know told me they love my personnality since im a funny and caring guy but they most likely would never date me and my crush is even part of those girls im planning to try to do something about that crush later this summer aka ask on a date but right now my life kinda looks like ill never be in a relationship and that sucks but i try to ignore that feeling else if would just make my sa worse all the time and im doing good and am happy right now so im in my prime for trying dating,2

outside i feel like such an alien going outside i dont know what its like to be normal i want to be normal so so bad ouch right in the feels i feel like ive had those exact thoughts replaying in my head for years im pretty much a anthrophobicsocialanxietyagoraphobia mash up who basically lives in constant fear both my parents have been teachers for years and both agree theyve never met anyone with as bad of anxiety as i have that one hurt to hear i used to lurk around here a lot on a different account but was always too afraid to post anything people kept lying saying it gets better every couple years itll be better soon im the only things that changed is i have a morbid sense of humor about my situation now but yeah i kind of have a plan to go out if things dont at least start looking up after this latest go with therapy i want to live and be happy i really do but id kill myself right now without hesitation if i knew i had to live the rest of my life the way i feel now,2
"outside, bike very similar experience to you i have just recently finished my final year of high school and i dont have a job so there is nothing to do all day but to sit around home and wait for the day to end this has been going on for a couple weeks now my average day consists of nothing but watching youtube videos doing the house work and reading reddit posts once every couple days i make the effort to go outside and go on a two and a half hour bike ride just for the sake of getting some exercise but other than that i dont often leave the house other than exercise there is absolutely nothing to justify the expenditure of going outside there is no money to spend there are no friends to talk or catch up with and there are no places which i want to visit i dont even go with my parents anywhere because i cant be bothered changing into something suitable that pretty much sums it up and with the future looking bleak it seems like this will continue well into next year i have a deep feeling that if this cycle was to continue unimpeded for another couple weeks i will probably get depressed or something it is truly a downward spiral and it is all because of my anxiety and low selfesteem",2
"walk, outside how do i f be comfortable around boys not be nervous and start a conversation ive known a classmate m since years now hes seriously a nice guy asked me to see him face to face in college im saying because i cant talk face to face with boys asked me to see him after class texted me he was looking out for me after exam sends hundred emojis in text asked me to video chat invited me to a city rally invited me to watch him play guitar sends me pictures of the place hes visiting asks me if i want something from that place sends me pictures of himself and his mother i dont know why mother too suddenly sends me a picture of a cut on his hand he got when he was playing guitar and captioned it love bite posts my text as his status on whatsapp last night out of the blue sent me pictures of his wins in pubg we were sitting in a room hes a coordinator of the committee and he walked past me and stood beside my chair all this when i dont reciprocate at all im always nervous so i just act like im least interested and come cold the one time i hit back was when i said it was a loss for a girl hes had a crush on and he told me about that and he proposed her and she rejected i dont feel anything special for him but i do notice his l behaviour which seems confusing to me if he already has a crush whys he trying to crush me well but my problem is that weve not talked beside texting although were in the same class but we dont talk in person i realise that he wants to talk but i just have nothing to say and no confidence to begin so i just sit and hope i get crushed under a rock anyone sane in my shoes will take this opportunity to reciprocate gel up hangout and see each other his crush is pretty outgoing and talks to boys and girls so everyone in general although shes not very friendly but l come off as boring nervous and clueless im pathetic but i dont want to be who knows if i actually talk to him in person instead of just texting him we may develop some emotions but i cant put into words how blank and awkward i feel ive lost so many opportunities by coming across as uninterested when boys i knew gave me clear signals of their interest but in my defence i was enjoying my life and not involved in premarital relationships thus being moral im quite conservative dont judge but now im old enough to be in a relationship with a decent man and marry him if all goes well im not kid anymore but the fuck i act like a kid because that hides my lack of confidence i was raised in a small town and wasnt allowed to talk to boys ive always kept some distance from men so it feels like approaching a whole new specie we were writing an exam today his friend and i were in the same class he came to our room after exam looked at us and tried to tell a joke went outside and looked at me for a while from the entrance when i went out of the room he was standing outside alone him and i saw each other and i rushed back into the classroom and walked away with a friend i wanted to talk to him i dont know if he did really stand there for me but he was still alone and i missed him im so anxious and nervous help",2

garden i think its kind of normal for people to watch other people in a non judging way it happens all the time and you really shouldnt feel that anxious but if you cant stop feeling the sa i can give you two advices maybe if you wear a hood youll feel less anxiety you can try buying or making your own automatic watering system this way youll only have to turn on the system and let the garden be watered,2
"bike, bicycle, run  it depends on if you live in an area where getting around on a bike is a viable option ive heard of people delivering doordash or postmates on bicycles but it generally is only more viable if you live in an urban area where restaurants and delivery addresses are closer together in a suburban area that is more carfocused its difficult the positive with these apps is you can accept or reject deliveries and set your own house which you cant do delivering for a pizza restaurant or jimmy johns but of course the trade off is you generally make more money actually delivering for a restaurant though if deliveries are slow they will usually make you do other tasks around the restaurant whereas with apps you can either run multiple apps at once or just fuck around between deliveries if its slow",2
"run, baseball oh man for my story i was almost above average in a lot of sports i was fit and a speedster back at my old school we had an aftercare after school and since my mom worked late everyday after school i would be there this started from kindergartenth grade which probably explains why i was decent at most sports i agree with you on that one volleyball is an anxiety inducing sport i was real bad because i couldnt serve i couldnt set and my wristarms hurt every time i hit the god damn ball like how tf do girls deal with that its real bad especially if the other team targets you because your the weak one in the team some other examples of anxiety in sports that ive felt looking back when your playing football and you run out you see the quarterback and he looks at you and then ignores you and continues with the play or he finally decides to throw it to you and sadly the catch is not received especially embarrassing if your wideopen same with baseball someone would hit a pop fly out to me and i would usually miss and have to throw it in the shame the shameeee the rest i would just try to make jokes on them i would feel the anxiety but i wasnt scared of doing the sports i was scared of failure and of losing i was real competitive back then it was like a different anxiety back then when i got into hs though i didnt make any sports teams lol and my anxiety was through the roof lol thats pretty funny looking back at it i would definitely hate though if i was in that position and someone said tough luck to me",2
running yes ive been struggling with this recently i joined a running group and while the people in it are nice they also pretty much just ignore you and talk among themselves it makes it so hard for me to actually connect and get to know them,2
nature i definetely get what you mean about loving yourself ive never been able to truly accept myself ive even been appalled by the idea of it like i feel so ugly stupid and worthless that i dont deserve to like myself or be liked by others i dont know where this negative self image comes from ive been treated well and with love my entire childhood so its probably more nature than nurture some people are just more self destructive than others i guess as a child i often navely wished to be a psychopath just so i wouldnt feel all that shame guilt and sadness all the time while i havent yet been able to love myself ive discovered the importance of having a healthy ego and not be ashamed of it this has helped me a lot as you can tell by this post im far from healed and i dont know if my mind will ever truly recover but nonreligious spritualismdivination including the use of ritualistic psychodrama and working with tarot and a pendulum has aided my mental health it works as a sort of meditation and gives me time for personal reflections it also gives me selfinduced confidence through ego boosting rituals most likely a placebosugar pill effect from believing strongly that i will see results im aware i hope to see greater progress in the future by continuing to do this i will also try to get hold of a therapist to talk about my issues just gotta work up the courage first also thanks for the tip regarding the portable therapist ill definetely check it out,0

"walk, outside, beach i hate going to the hair salon i go to this hair salon that my mom always goes to the owner is vietnamese i am also vietnamese and my family is too and the hairdressers there are also vietnamese the particular hair salon is the only choice i have because its for a haircut my mom pays for me since i have no job and is what i can afford im not familiar with regular hair salon places that charge more money they may do a better job giving me a haircut but i am poor come from a low income family so i will never be able to afford it from personal experience i always bring a picture of a haircut that i want i downloaded the pictures to my phone the last time i got a haircut maybe over a month ago i wanted a pixie cut i downloaded pictures of like a asian girl that had my hair type and she had a really nice pixie cut so i saved the picture of the front view of the pixie cut and the back view of the pixie cut simple right i came to the salon at pm and the store closes at pm so i still had a lot of time i walked into the hair salon with my mom sat down at the chair in the waiting area my mom asked the hairdresser who is the owner to cut my hair because she cut my hair the last time and she did a okay job cutting my hair they did speak okay english but i was not fluent in vietnamese so its hard to talk to them plus even if i spoke all in english it would be awkward at least for me so i tried to speak vietnamese and english i showed her the pictures and i said i want to cut my hair this short like this pixie cut she asked me are you sure you want it this short i pointed to my ears and said i want the sides to be this short and my hair to be short as well and my bangs to be trimmed so it doesnt cover my eyes and not too short its above my eyebrows and she was like okay so i sat down at the chair i took my glasses off i am blind without my glasses i cannot see shit which gave me anxiety the lady starts cutting my hair i got a little nervous since i wasnt able to see anything i wanted to remind her just dont cut it too short cause like then i would have to wear a hat although pixie cuts are suppose to be short at first so they can grow out and look really nice but i was not confident in myself to do that i eventually reminded her just dont cut my bangs too short not above my eyebrows and she said yeah i didnt cut it too short when she was done blowdryed my hair then i finally put my glasses on to be able to see it it was okay it wasnt perfect i brushed my bangs to the side to get a better lookstyle i didnt want my bangs to just hang straight down my forehead i also asked her if i was able to part my bangs to the left as well since thats how pixie cuts work and all it was able to part both sides okay again the haircut wasnt bad but i still had anxiety about it so i asked for a hand held mirror to look at it closely the hairdresser got a mirror so i can look at my hair from the back as well btw the entire time she cut my hair my mom was having a conversation with her in vietnamese sigh why mom so that added to my anxiety i think the owner asked me questions for small talk like what grade are you in how old are you hows school whats your favorite subject i am a highschool student btw so i politely answered her she was nice she wasnt pushy or tried to baby talk to me just because i was also i realized the owner took literally minutes maybe to cut my hair i felt like she totally rushed it would it be fair for me to pay her for minutes of her time apparently the owners husband was waiting for her outside in his car and that she was going to leave soon um your store closes at pm i arrived at pm you arent suppose to leave early even if you had a customer youre supposed to make sure to cut her hair properly so what you were planning to go with your husband to the beach or something that day you cant just be like oh i dont have time for this i have a life too do you not care about your job and reputation eventually after staring at my hair and messing with it i think i told her to add a little gel she did last time and it made my hair look nice and styled the hair gel gave my bangs texture and i was able to successfully part it to the right i realized i needed to buy hair gel so my hair would look pretty so eventually the hairdresser left with her husband i stared at my hair some more in the waiting area i asked to borrow a comb so i could comb it to one side eventually i realized since the owner took very little time she could have thinned out my hair better with scissors so it would look nicer and more even but no she said she was going to leave with her husband and she knew i was not too sure i was confident with my hair because i kept on asking for mirrors and staring at my hair a lot plus i was asking her a lot of question after she finished my haircut i guess she ignored my attempts of telling her to fix my hair and spend more time on it oh it looks nice i think its good enough already so yeah afterwards she left i left the hair salon and then asked my mom to go to the beauty supply store since the hair gelwax at the salon was it was way too expensive i found a nice hair gel at the supply store it was cheap only dollars and it actually worked well on my hair when i got home i felt the same feeling of anxiety and felt depressed like i usually do after a haircut i know i basically just shared you my story of my experience with hairdresser i dont know if this helped you but i am glad if it did helped you somewhat d my advice is to have an idea of what you want your hair to look like do you want a trim do you want something like bangs nothing too crazy or complicated if you want you can also download some reference pictures of what you want your hair to look like this will be easier for you to describe to the hair dresser what kind of haircut you want this will avoid miscommunication and avoid the person to mess up your hair and you ending up paying for a ugly haircut but you probaly wouldnt need a picture if you wanted something simple like getting your hair trimmed at the ends also be polite if the hairstylist makes small talk and asks you questions about your personal life answer their questions just be polite be yourself thats all the advice i have im sorry if i am bad at giving advice but good luck i relate to you a lot i usually give short answers when asked questions too many of us have anxiety when it comes to getting a haircut if you want you can pm me or add me as a friend or something lol good luck have a nice day",0
outside do you ever feel like youll never really be normal sometimes it feels like it wont ever really change my world feels so small and the outside world feels better when im alone i sometimes listen to sad music and i feel like crying but i cant im and i maybe should be going to college but i have no direction and collegebesides how expensive it is seems so unfriendly and alien i wish i could be one of those people who could just go up to someone who looks cool but i cant i feel like im better than ive ever been but at the same time i feel so behind everyone else thinking about ending up married with kids and a career fills me with so much dread but it feels like thats the only way ill ever feel complete my parents are so social and open and i just dont get where they went wrong with me sorry if this is depressing but its a depressing feeling to have and i dont know if itll ever really go away,0
"walk, run i was in such a similar situation months ago i was i just turned in october and i didnt have a job i worked a seasonal job at macys for months last year and then havent worked because i didnt want to go to another interview other people have good tips another thing i want to add getting a job and i know its really hard and scary will help you because youll be forced to be social and it will get easier i even found that i when i had my job at macys and when i got my current job i became a lot less likely to be anxious in my day to day social interactions like in school when i didnt have a job i slipped back into a much more anxious state because i got used to not talking to people i actually find that interacting with customers as a cashier is a social skill that improves super quickly and becomes pretty easy in my experience this is because you know what to expect there is a script in a sense of what to say and it dozens really matter what they respond just do what you have to do and theyre gone its not personal which makes it better for me i dont have to worry about impressing them or being too this or too that or coming up with something funny or interesting to say im just ringing them up the difficult part is definitely interviewing and interacting with managerscoworkers and the like if youd rather not interact with coworkers get a job at a big department stores like macys i actually disliked how isolated i felt there but for some people that might work for them really you just have to force yourself i know hats often a pretty annoying and useless thing to say to people with social anxiety but my point is you are most likely going to be nervous and thats okay that doesnt mean though that you cant do it my current job required me to go in for an interview and i was terrified but i just drove there and didnt let myself think about it too much then i got there and instead of waiting in my car i instantly walked in i was nervous but sitting around wouldnt change that and once youre there either at your job or at an interview everything will be okay this is hard for me to explain but it just gets a little better once youve thrown yourself and youre he only one who can do that into the situation sure you could be shy and awkward and anxious and lack social skills but youll be there people are interacting with you and youre interacting back however you are doing it chances are you wont run and hide in a corner is kind of what im saying youll be doing it and what happens happens at that point at my interview my manager asked me are you shy honestly i hated that because i was trying so hard to fake that i wasnt shy and i didnt feel like i was acting quiet just maybe a little anxious but i said no he responded saying its okay if you are but youre just quiet then i said i guess and he wrote on his piece of paper not shy just quiet on my first day a few of my coworkers saw it and laughed pretty hard at it who wrote that about her they said hey werent making fun of me in fact they saw it as quite odd that he would find that relevant to write down i laughed with them they never treated me weird because of it i mean they probably saw me as shy too but it was okay okay this is getting long but what im saying is that as a person who was just in this spot i know that it seems impossible for you but it really isnt im not trying to downplay anyones difficulty with this because i know how hard it is and i still feel socially anxious at work all of the time and im not best friends with my coworkers and when customers try to make small talk with me im not really good at it at all but thats okay because i have a job and it pays and i actually really enjoy going there for a while i got anxious every time i had to go in for my shift i would have butterflies in my stomach getting ready driving there and especially walking in the door but after a while this went away if you get a job and even after a month or so you still feel extremely anxious there and it isnt getting better especially if the anxiety persists throughout the entire shift consider getting a different job although thats very scary feeling comfortable or as comfortable as a person with sa can be working a social job lol at your job should be a priority by no means am i saying that social anxiety can just go away with repetition or whatever but if you tend to get stronger anxiety related to new situations staying in those situations until its no longer new can help a little also sometimes certain environments can be very anxiety inducing for some people but that doesnt mean that you cant have a job in general which is what i want to point out you might always feel anxiety but the level can vary so if you hate the environment of your job think about changing it another tip i have is maybe getting a job with a friend if there is anywhere where one of your friends work that is hiring it might be helpful to work with them because you can ask them about things youre unsure about such as social norms there or just basic job questions youre too afraid to ask coworkers okay so i rambled again but basically people with social anxiety can have jobs and hat includes you thats my main message feel free to ask more",0
running getting a dog when you have social anxiety hey ive always wanted a dog since i was a little child unfortunately i was not allowed from my parents i have always wondered when would be the right time and i really think it would help me with my social anxiety but at the same time it would also limit me since i cant just leave it at home if i break out of my shell and would start to attend social gatherings i am and currently without job or education living at my dads place but will most likely start new education in february and move out i want a dog so badly running in the woods with it training and feeling less lonely but then i would have to always turn down social events just like now but now it wouldnt be a choice what do you guys think about dogs and social anxiety any experiences or suggestions,0

run i hate how social anxiety isnt seen as a valid excuse someone with a broken leg wouldnt get made to run a race yet i get made to stand in front of the class for minutes and talk when you say you have anxiety people are just like oh well suck it up it doesnt work like that it stops me from physically being able to do things,0

"walk, outside i have just gone to bed at am after spending hours at a houseparty with people and of which i never met before today and ive just been wandering back and forth between the dance floor and the lounge and bar talking to people for minute at a time or less until awkward silence kicked in and made them uncomfortable how to make people dislike you in one night and has only just begun i just ran out of awkwardnessattempts and decided i wanted to go to sleep instead music is still booming loud out there and the people are still there it felt like a walk of shame im here as my sisters little brother and were all adults so i feel like ive been the ultimate portrayal of selfdefeatedness ive not bonded with one person out of and tomorrow im going back to my city and study in my dorm and continue to go down my hole of loneliness because every time i go outside im met with people i just cant relate to",0
running i wish people knew how hard im trying i feel like im running just to stand still and im still behind everybody else i had a feedback meeting with my boss today and he kept talking about how i need to improve my communication skills and open up and talk more hes actually kind of nice about it and he explained why one would need good communication skills at work but there is still a place for someone quiet in an office what hurts most is when they ask why im quiet i respond with thats just who i am im a quiet person or something and they go oh we can tell everyone can tell they probably dont mean it in a rude way theyre just saying it but considering its my biggest insecurity its hard to get past it so anyways he have me more tasks that involve speaking to other people so id get better at it he was talking about other people in the office who are also introverts i guess asked me if somethings wrong or if somethings bothering me its like he wanted me to change but whenever he said that word he tried making it clear that being quiet isnt necessarily the wrong way to be its just not normal i suppose since its already been a couple of months and weve went on a work trip and i should have opened up by now he also asked how i managed university and said that if our team at work was any bigger or smaller it would have been even harder for me to adapt he made a lot of sense but i cant help but feel like even more of a broken person now and i cant stop pitying myself i told him that i realize all these things and i think about them frequently to which he responded dont think about it just do it i feel so alone going through this and nobody around me seems to understand how big of a deal and how much of a problem this is to me i feel so isolated and i dont know how much longer i can keep this up i couldnt stop shaking at work today ill never stop trying but i wish someone would tell me that what im going through is real and that there is a way out of it i understand why it would seem stupid and insignificant because plenty of people have bigger problems than that but the anxiety is completely blinding my ability to see anything else and if feels insurmountable im tired of people telling me to just get over it do it think positive never say you cant do something if this is poorly written and doesnt make sense its because i am typing this while sobbing in my bed im thinking about having to wake up and go to work tomorrow morning and deal with everything all over again and then again and again and again on top of that i have another work trip to go to this weekend so yay more opportunities to bond with my coworkers cant wait ha,0
outside social anxiety when young now i cant feel anything when i was young i had pretty bad social anxiety especially around adults or persons of authority other than my own parents in their presence i couldnt think properly speak properly and was just very anxious etc i hated break time the most because i did not dare to buy food from the school cafeteria gave me incredible anxiety to open my mouth and order stuff so my mum would pack my lunch daily other than that i was a typical kid although a bit quiet and introverted but otherwise had friends and was relatively normal i was never diagnosed or treated because i was one of the brightest pupils in my school so no one suspected anything and the condition was relatively unknown in my country now that im older i feel like the sheer stress caused by my social anxiety broke some kind of switch in my brain and now im totally asocial perfectly content with my life with zero social interaction my anxiety also miraculously transformed into an unbreakable confidence i can do anything in public without shame and no longer even care about being judged eg wearing totally inappropriate clothing outside and not even being able to care about people staring at me when someone criticizes me or taunts me i am physically incapable of being affected by it usually my response is to laugh and shrug it off people think im some kind of incredibly stoic unshakable person who can remain calm even in the most dire situations its like i have totally lost any motivation to be social because my brain remembers how crappy it was with sa and wants to protect me from it and is doing its job too damn well im totally content with my largely solitary life right now and have totally no desire for friendship let alone a relationship but part of me fears that im missing out on social interaction which is a major part of most peoples life then again i have an extremely introverted personality and have always felt that i wanted to live a solitary life my mother is very worried about my asociality which makes me feel kind of bad as well tldr used to be socially anxious now im the most stoic person youll ever meet and fear that it might just be some kind of defense mechanism or maybe its just that im extremely introverted,0
outside my boyfriend said i held him back at a wedding i cant get over this comment i went to a wedding on my boyfriends side of the family not knowing anyone except for him i was a bit nervous but expected to be with him most of the time while we were there he kept leaving me alone with his parents so he could smoke outside he got annoyed when i went with him and said when cant i just talk to his parents i did talk to them as much as i could but i found it a bit awkward to be left with them constantly on the way back from smoking hed start chatting to an older family member uncle or grandparent for a significant while leaving me to just sit on my own or with his parents when i asked him if i could go with him on his next smoke break he reluctantly agreed but then outside said that i was holding him back from talking to his extended family it made me feel so awkward like i never want to go to a wedding again i feel like i tried my best but i was just in the way was his comment justified how can i get over it,0

"walk, run would you go out with any girl thats in couple i seriously doubt you would theres some awful bitch some that you may consider really ugly etc you wouldnt but still theres a man that does theres someone for everyone even you stop comparing you you arent them and they arent you isnt there some school subject that you are naturally good at social skills are the same some are better than other you just dont have the same skills what would someone else do if they want to be as good as you in that school subject they would just be jealous and keep comparing themselves to you no they would study more and invest more time over it thats it its the same for social skills you need to practice to become better i dont think you want to be that guy either you can be but thats not you and it will require so much effort from you what you can do though is becoming a little bit comfortable in a social situation often we see our social anxiety like a wall that we simply cant pass but i see it more like a walking in a fog you can do it but you need to walk carefully and its possible that you hit a wall from time to time it may hurt a little more if you try to run too fast the key is to do it slowly a single step at a time when you feel like your anxiety is too high stop it and see how you did and what you can change it make it easier i wont go into details but thats the basic of how i started to handle mine",0
camp crying at social events ever since i was little if i was ever left alone or placed in a social setting alone i would cry for example my family enrolled me into a summer day camp i did not know anyone there and got so scared and nervous i cried at the breakfast table as soon as i got there at family functions or social gatherings if my older siblings or relatives didnt want to stay with me young graveyardmalibu i cried even though there was family members there and they all knew me this fear still kinda haunts me as an adult f certain things i am okay with like going to the store and eating at restaurants alone this one incident i went to the club by myself i tense up get really nervous and scared and start to cry ended up leaving really early has this ever happened to anyone or am i just weird lol i want to get over this as an item on my bucket list and learn how to travel and go to music festivals solo in the future,0
outside there were times when i literally ate my lunch or snack in the school bathroom just to avoid eating with strangers or people that bothered me i dont do that anymore because my anxiety got a lot better but it was so terrible in college the bathroom was private and huge but in high school the year i didnt have almost any friend in that school it was a small individual bathroom where i ate not lunch but the snack and tmy feet were visible from outside so i squatted on the toilet lid yes ridiculous hahaha what a time lmao,0
sun me me i do lmao i always wear a mask in every occasion like for example sweet party prom social interaction and still many more but when i arrive at my home or in a empty place i feel relieve that i can remove my mask this because my sun is gemini which rule my physic but my moon is libra which rule my emotion and thought so yeah basically i can mask my real emotion and feeling which is afraid to talk to other or meet many people,0
running stuck in time i kind of feel like im stuck in time everyone is doing their stuff having fun having drama and im there too but im not allowing myself to do all of these things its more like my anxiety is holding me back its as if we all were running a race but im sinking in the ground so cant get any further and i see everyone passing by,0
camp dont ever let someone elses opinion stop you from doing what you like exactly dont be discouraged by what other people say to you serena there are billions of people living in this world and they all have their own tastes and perspectivesits just physically impossible to be in the same camp with everyone yknow just like what op said there are lots of ppl that enjoy seeing your memes here and theyll certainly miss you if you stop posting,0
run hard to believe how accurate this is ive been able to grow a lot in the last few years now im and more confident and believe i am outgoing that being said when i was in my earlier twenties laying down to sleep was tuff because you run through every word you say and actions you habe done during the day creating a wall of anxiety thats crushing the longer you think,0
outside when i left the store and got back outside i considered just getting in my car and leaving years ago i wouldve done exactly that nowadays though i just dont have the time to let my anxiety consume me like i used to,0

"walk, run seems to me that you need to own up to your anxiety in hopes of cutting down on the time spent getting to class and the things you could do is spend time in the area but not entirely walk through the main gate try to spend time in the close vicinity of the main gate and just watch as everyone else has to go through there to get to class like they should as its the best way to get to class right whatever everyone else has on their mind is each to their own but no one will specifically remember you going through the main gate as everyones attention is mostly set on themselves much like you focus on yourself mostly as well if you thought of someone how long could you go thinking about that person before you end up consumed with yourself again chances are no one will even care or just briefly talk about you and move on i feel like i make this sound easy when it truly isnt anxiety is no joke but i wanted to share some facts that my psychologists have told me that helped me realize that im not in the spotlight and neither am i the main focus for everyone and someone that everyone thinks about i dont know if this is something that you struggle with as well but im hoping it could help either way for yourself to lead somewhat of a easier time and actually using the main gate like any other student would that has a bunch of their own things to care about best of luck using the main gate and i hope if its somewhat difficult for you that you allow yourself to familiarize yourself with the area and hopefully own up to it and give your anxiety a good run for it",0
park look on the bright side you dont have to paycare for other people and you get to do explicitly the things that you want to do for much cheaper for example have the prices on expenses no one to complain about where you eat or where you are going when i personally travel to a location i always go out of my way to visit local museums and historical sites but most people of this generation including girls dont want to visit such places plus i can be there for long as i want and there is nobody sitting in the car park texting me to hurry up,0
running heart pounds right before i answer the phone at work fear of the unknown why the team leads usually take care of phone calls and they usually have to do with customers orders either they want a refund on something a change or simply cancelation i often get treated like garbage because i ignore the phone despite me being the one closest to it i have this debilitating feeling when im about to answer i think the one right thing i can do is introduce myself and where i work after that my voice shakes i have this full body experience and it gets harder to breathe my face flushed and i feel like a complete idiot a lot of the times i cant even make out what theyre saying to me if its something they want to take off of their order i manage to do that task but i always seem to mess something up later in the day they will ask who took off what for so and sos order id raise my hand then theyd tell me i took off the wrong thing perhaps errors occur because im running on pure adrenaline it sounds so stupid i am stupid why am i like this,0

outside i think those people were raised in a family that always tell them that you must do things for the greater good i dont think its natural for someone to do themselves in for a stranger or wife or an ideology without having been influcenced by outside forces the most logical thing is to stay alive what good does it do to change something for the better if you will never be there to experience it also is sacrificing your own life the best you could have done were there no other options really what if the outcome would have been better had you stayed alive instead,0

sun holy fuck dude are you me ive been suffering with this for years and its soooo annoying for example going through a checkout and cashier makes small talkinstant blush anyone new speaking to me blush someone speaks to me out of nowhereblush even people and family ive known foreverblush everysingletime even at work a colleague speaks to meblush again people i know blush i think the worst thing about this is when people point it out and it makes it so so so much worse i just want to crawl and hide away and makes my tomato face as bright as the sun the only way ive heard to deal with this is to put yourself in these situations constantly and just not to give a shit if you go red but this seems so much harder than it seems goodluck man,0
run can antidepressants help me live in the moment hello i was just prescribed lexapro mg after finally deciding to get some help been suffering from sa for lots of years now rip i feel like a lot of my inability to make a conversation is because i cant fully concentrate on the person before me you know a lot of it is because of anxiety making my mind run mph yea but then theres also other things that prevent me from living in the moment past events popping up maybe prevent me from saying something i feel is too dangerous things that havent even happened yet overall it just makes a conversation way too boring because im playing it too safe i dont want to just get by but rather impress people make them laugh and stuff etc and i feel really bad for that person if i showed them a boring time like that when i know i can do much better,0
walk ignore the others its easy to be company in anothers pain solutions arent precise and are most certainly unique i say what i do and i get others to do is i get them out of the house and out walking and talking grocery stores are my favorite place to do it because you can find things to look at or think about anything besides the stressful events that are out of your hand if you cant leave the house trying cleaning or making something with your hands i feel like a busy mind is more likely if im not moving doing nothing hence why im not sleep right now lol,0
"walk, sun how can i feel like this all the time hey everyone im sorry if this gets kind of long but i just needed to get it off my chest and maybe ask for some of your thoughts tldr at the bottom if you dont care to read but id be grateful if you would ive dealt with social anxiety since i was in st grade first time i noticed it affecting me at least of course i didnt know thats what it was at the time and i just felt really sick all of the time tried counseling and such but i think i was just too young at that point im now and i havent let this stupid thing beat me down yet its hell for sure but it will not get the best of me anyway something that i have noticed recently is that i can sometimes get myself into this extremely confident state where i could not care less about what people think of me and i am super outgoing but it is rare it doesnt last long and soon im back to trying not to puke in anticipation of the next social encounter i have to face i have an example but it needs a little setup i work at a fast food restaurant where most of my coworkers are girls and thats awesome and terrifying for the first several months i hardly spoke to anyone one of my managers even thought that i hated her because i never even tried to make small talk with her fortunately my cousin works at the same place and let her know that its just the way i am until you get to know me thanks for looking out man eventually i came out of my shell a little bit and i became pretty good friends with of my managers they were the only ones that i felt really comfortable talking with and i looked forward to working with them whenever possible recently that got really complicated manager the one who thought i hated her but doesnt anymore tells me that both managers and my good friends have crushes on me despite the fact that they already have boyfriends confuses and scares the hell out of me even though i am pretty happy about it i liked them from the beginning there are some major problems now and my anxiety about it is through the roof i have exactly experience with girls and i dont want to screw this up they both have longtime boyfriends and im not getting in the middle of that at this point even though manager a good friend of the other two tells me this news straight up i cannot bring myself to believe it because my selfesteem is kind of shot anyway now working with either one or both of them is something i both look forward to and dread because just thinking about it makes me sick screw you brain ill be honest im kind of obsessed thinking about both of them now not in a creepy way at all just in the classic anxiously replaying past interactions in my head sort of way so finally we get to that example i mentioned last week i had a shift with one of my friendcrushmanagers and i was absolutely sick to my stomach the whole night felt like complete shit and barely made it through the shift without emptying my guts all over the store the next day i work again only this time its not with either of these two girls somehow on the way to work i got into this mindset that i was the most confident person on the planet and as soon as i walked in the door everybody greeted me like we were best friends this never happens these people rarely speak to me and now over the entire shift they are chatting it up with me and the best part is i felt completely comfortable with it having conversations about everything under the sun and loving it no feeling sick to my stomach no panic i felt like i was thriving and i felt normal for once i want that again i want it bad and i want it all the time one more thing worth mentioning that is not related to work but still important is that i lifted weights for the first time in a long time a few days ago i basically pushed myself to the limit and afterwards i had that feeling again im assuming thats the endorphins kicking ass but i dont know for sure endorphins wouldnt really explain the mindset i had going into work would they anyway ive gone on for way too long as it is but there is so much more that i feel like i want to say im really glad that i found this sub because it feels awesome to have support from people who know what i am going through if anybody has any ideas about how to get into this state of mind again i would be incredibly happy to hear about it stay strong everyone thanks tldr on rare occasion i can get myself into an insanely confident state of mind that basically eliminates my anxiety how can i do it more often",0
nature all the time and the feeling remains till this day i have dysthymia as well and if it wasnt for my fearful nature fear actually helping somewhat here i probably wouldnt be here typing this today ill echo what others say time to find a counselor or any professional someone you could actually express yourself out to face to face as i feel youre in a pretty dark place right now and you are definitely going to need some assistance and some coping techniques to move yourself out of a rut also try keeping a journal if youre lazy to write you can always find a couple online ones where you could simply type at least for me it helps as a venting tool and while it may not necessarily solve problems it will probably bring you some kind of relief overall,0
runs you can always try and see how you feel after you wont get addicted after drinking one time or even after the first few times one tip id say is to just space out your drinking bc you can build a tolerance for it which would require that you drink more to achieve the same feeling and that can get bad if you get alcohol poisoning it sounds like youre mostly into just tasting it tho and you didnt say it runs in your family so i honestly think youd be fine to test it out and see how things go,0
run its what you were thinking ive been suicidal for like years and the most ive ever been in these past days i had a nose bleed in the shower recently that i let run for the longest time was in a total zone staring off into space i figured if i had let it bleed long enough i wouldve had a heart attack or something but my head was slightly tilted so it just stopped by the end i was completely covered in blood looked like a vampire after a kill,0
riding why do we have this anxiety its time to find the roots of this bitch and pull them out because i believe there to be a reason for everything these weeds of anxiety in my mind have got to meet the flame of confidence if my mind is not going to function properly its not going to have the privilege of riding up front i need my heart and intuition to be in the drivers seat you cant control thoughts but you sure as hell influence them for anyone struggling check out this audio,0
run i try to stay physically healthy by eating right getting enough rest and exercising because it helps me to see things more clearly and good physical health has a positive affect on mental health another thing ive done is keep a journal to scribble my thoughts and emotional feelings down in whenever im distraught and this helps a lot with it plus i can review the writings later to gain perspective finally and this i the biggest ive accepted my anxiety and lack of social skill because those two things arent really my fault my anxiety was created when people treated me poorly and this led to me isolating myself in high school because i didnt know how to handle it accept to run and i didnt have anyone to help me in a constructive way so my social development is behind others in some ways these arent things i had much control over at the time so why hate myself now for things that arent my fault realizing this has made me happier and more content person and allows me to work through these issues without always feeling like a failure,0
outside i was planning on putting in the work and taking one step at a time going outside on my breaks stuff like that but as soon as i set foot in the lecture room the fear set in and all i could do was stare at the floor the reason i cant look at people aside from the backs of their heads is because im afraid theyll see me and think im staring at them and they wont want to be near me anymore i was rejected constantly for the first thirteen years of my life and now im terrified of going back to that point i dont know how to take the first step when every fiber of my being is screaming at me not to,0

pool having a shitty customer service job definitely helped me interact with people i wouldnt recommend getting into customer service for this reason alone since it was otherwise a pretty miserable job but if you need a job and customer service is the best option you take what you can get does social anxiety ever get better with practice its kind of like getting into a cold pool you get used to it after a while and it doesnt feel as cold you also get used to the initial shock when you first step in each time its still cold but you become a bit desensitized in a way,0
"climb, tree when you go through life trying to be good at things youre not meant to be good at its like a fish trying to climb a tree of course youre going to feel very stupid and eventually give up you need to identify things that youre good at and develop mastery i refuse to believe that you have talent in everything everyone is good at something you just havent discovered it",0
camp i understand your concern about meds i take ssris but honestly the effect is mild and i dont want to up the dosage anymore group therapy is interesting in my case its mostly doing activities like on a summer camp with others or practicing social situations like interviews doctor visits calling people etc at the end of the session you can tell others in the group how you felt during the therapy what was hard for you and so on ive only been twice so far after the sessions i was absolutely exhausted but didnt get a panic attack which was a plus,0
sun i got super dark car window tint today by accident i recently got a new used car and it had absolutely no tint and i really hate being exposed to the sun and being stared at by dudes so i decided to get tint on my windows in my state you are allowed to have as low as tint and that is what i was planning to get well i got to the shop and i feel really nervous around car guys for some reason so was really in my head and anxious when he asked me what tint i wanted for some reason i just blurted out which is as low as you can get and is basically blackout and super illegal i just nodded when he asked if i was sure and then went and sat down and immediately hated myself i had an opportunity to change it later when he came back in to give the previous customers keys back but i felt so embarrassed to change my mind that i didnt say anything now im driving around with blackout tint on all my windows and am so fucking anxious that im gonna get pulled over or hit some poor old lady in a crosswalk while making a right turn and worst of all i cant roll the windows down for hours and have to drive up to manhattan from baltimore tomorrow and im scared to death im gonna get pulled over i feel so fucking stupid i dont understand why i cant even function over such a simple thing im so upset at myself why am i like this,0
outside yeah you can basically you need to make a gym schedule and stick to it that way you have a higher chance of seeing the same people at the gym also its not like your gonna be striking up conversations left and right after all at the gym most people are focused on their work out but if you see the same people all the time just say hello and keep doing it every time you see them before you know it theyll be saying hello to you finally if you see someone you see at the gym outside in the world or visa versa say hello and if your really desperate to talk to people at the gym just ask to work in with people,0

"outside, run social anxiety the essentials part see the st part i made herethe group project presentation almost a cliche for nervousness the school or work presentation is truly an instrument of social anxiety torture i dont care whatever benefits they may try to push like team building or collaboration ive never felt anything after a presentation was over other than a massive psychological sigh of relief working with a group used to be hard for me in school reading syllabushearing about upcoming projects and therefore presentation always inspired complete overwhelming panic firstly when you are shy or anxious forcing kids to team up already puts you at a huge disadvantage you are going to be that quiet kid at the end of everyone moving desks who has to respond to if youre lucky enough for the teacher to ask who doesnt have a group then you get tacked on to the group of friends who all know each other and spend most of the time talking about plans after school gossiping about people or what pussy they slammed last night rather than talking about the project as if all the forced interactions throughout a school day didnt already stress you out enough in college this became less of a problem the group selection was usually random and a large percentage of the class are all solo kids who dont know anyone so you all enter the process on an even playing field and often you could discuss the project and not waste time because everyone just wants to get it over with and go home working in the group itself can be interesting because sometimes i became the leader mainly because everyone else had so much else going on they didnt want to really engage a lot other times a really controlling loud mouth girl would make all the choices you know who you are ultimately outside a few awkward meetings with kids outside of class most of the time it went smoothly because your all in the same boat just trying to get a grade and get out the most significant part of the anxiety comes from the anticipation and execution of the presentation itself so many thoughts swirl in the background of your mind im going to look so unprepared im going to feel embarrassed and everyone will notice i will stumble and look and feel stupid and you get so nervous as each group goes up you feel your heart could explode from the stress your leg shaking sweating using every ounce of energy to not collapse or run right out of there this is not the usual nerves this is your mind detecting a false threat and activating stress hormones forcing you into a panicked state of survival ive had mixed results over time sometimes i am complete sweat flop and red and shaking other times i hold my composure and perform ok regardless of the outcome the process i described before is always the same total fear id like to think one day that i can feel semicomfortable with presentations i havent had to do one in a long while so i havent had to test it i remember feeling really nervous and speaking shakey voice cracking during a dept wide meeting crammed into a little tiny conference room all the bosses and their directors were starring at me when i spoke the room was so small so maybe im in no position to give advice on this but advice if youre going to present fill out a lot of information on the powerpoint presentationslideshow and read off it yes i know the rules say sometimes do not read off slides but if you do good job an answer all the questions and cover the main point of the project then who really cares you may get docked points or even get no points off at all it helped a lot if i stared down at the computer screen as well and looked up maybe once or twice the entire time blocking out the audience it looks a lot more natural then you think be prepared with knowledge that is your weapon to survive sometimes the anxiety overwhelms you it has happened to me just gotta power through them the best you can and know nobody whos watching cares at all just like how when you watch other groups the only thing on your mind is your project another cliche tip actually practice what youre going to say readout loud your slide show several times each day by the time you actually have to do it it feels more comfortable because you know what you sound like saying it this way you can control speed and tone better people without anxiety professors dont understand how scary these things are for us seriously its as if youre entering a dangerous situation and your mind is screaming at your body to run im not pretending that i ever will or want to be a great public speaker but my advice is for survival if your going through a presentation or group project right now and have social anxiety i seriously feel your pain and arent alone its hell ive been tormented by them for over a decade depending on your career choice you may never have to do them again or at least to much smaller audiences andxb freinds freind groups this is a hot topic and often the main point of anxiety for many the anxiety i feel comes from feelings of inadequacy or failure we see people around us hoarding friends like money tons and tons of friends communicating traveling talking and you look at yourself and think i dont or cant have that and therefore i am not successful and failed socially ive fallen into that mind trap before and have felt badly or low about my limited social life but my situation is unique in the fact that i slowly absorbed into my brothers friend group my brother had random friends over the house since he was really young and over time formed a group that i was always kinda in around so while i still was super shy super awkward and had all my social anxiety quirks i still could participate in capacity with friends i often got backlash from my sister and mother who would say they are your brothers friends why dont you have your own friends that often made me feel sad and alone and threatened today we are all still friends and are going through all the adult pains of moving away career no time for funhangouts ect the good news for those not in that unique situation is i have since made friends outside of the group i met two others that i connected with through appsonline i think its easier this way because im not the type to strike up a conversation with random people and really avoid eye contact with strangers and talking online and connecting first is nice because you get to know them and see if there is compatibility meeting in person for the first time can be insanely uncomfortable and awkward that can be really stressful because you built an online persona for them and you go in with expectations and you can leave disappointed when they dont seem to act the way you thought they would they have those expectations for you too so its a lot of stress and baggage you bring to the meetup just try and leave that baggage at home and not have any expectations sometimes speaking on the phone before the meeting can break down a lot of fears and get it out of the way even calling as you pull up and ask hey where are you yea i know see my first post on phone use just dont expect anything to happen and try and be flexible to everything that comes advice before you do anything you must first do one thing destroy the idea that having a lot of friends means your a happy and successful because thats bullshit we are all different and require different levels of solicitation for me i would love to just have really close best friend if your looking for freinds or even dates talking to people online can be a way to get to know people for me it was datinghook up apps it took me a long time to find legit people i connected with youre going to have to weed through s not joking of people to find the one or two gems people that are complete assholes that dont want the same things as you or people that are flat as a board personalitywise it may make you feel terrible because so much time and energy goes into you may have to reject people people will definitely reject you it can really start to affect your selfworth when it feels like your not making friends trust me keep trying and the navigation of the process teaches you a lot about yourself and socialization i learned that you have to derive our self worth from within you and not rely on the acceptance of other people to make you feel valuable it was a lesson hard learned people you take the leap of faith in meeting in person may ghost you afterward they will say your not confident enough or you are not like how you were online just take those hits and pick up where you left off it builds a tougher skin over time building yourself up after getting knocked down so you are ready for the moment you connect with the gem of a person and really get along another point i want to make i used to have the tendency to put myself down a lot talking to people i was really insecure about many things and my selfdefense mechanism was to put myself down before the others would dont do this and actively avoid it people pick up on it and can easily get turned away youre sending out a false image of yourself and killing the opportunity to connect by saying bad things about yourself and how your not good enough it becomes super obvious to me now when other people do it just how insecure they are and how afraid they are of being rejected by me so like i said in my last post be kind to yourself internally and externally through your words",0

outside its the resting bitch face syndrome most introverts have this thing as they are not focused on their outside but more on the inside and their thoughts and there is no absolute for beauty so you may say youre ugly but other people may find you attractivebeautiful in your own way fun story about rbfresting bitch face i have a mean look rbf so i was in line at the supermarket one person told me to hold his place while she got some milk i agreed and waited for her as she was taking too long i tried to stall the line a bit by asking some prices i already had a doubt on she got to the line and saw me talking to the cashier and saw my face and apologized a lot and she told me to not be angry when i realized i was focused and had my rbf i changed my expression a bit so she would know i wasnt mad and i even smiled a bit she understood and seem grateful for waiting for her so she thanked me for being a great person and left the line of the supermarket i finished buying my goods and as i was leaving this person greeted me at the exit door with an ice cream cone d rbf can be a curse sometimes but we need to manage it and take advantage of the surprises we can give people sometimes,0
outside i can relate to this excepting my classes are ampm so i eat home but well when we have free time it felt like hell because i dont have almost any friends and we cant go outside school while most of the schools where i live lets people go outside after th grade im in th grade and you still cant do that in my school so i used to lock myself in the bathroom i felt like shit and sometimes like crying because i felt people were coming to the bathroom and i was scared theyd find out but it was better than being alone in front of everyone and them looking at me,0
soccer best feeling ever so my meeting with my friends got cancelled and it is such a relief now i can stay at the comfort of home and watch the soccer game anyone else who gets happy when plans get cancelled,0
run im the same way i am and and in college i feel like i intimidate people because of my stature heck i know people are intimidated by me ive been told most times they finish by saying but youre actually really nice when you do talk not to make me sound like i the nicest fucking person in the world my height has absolutely made me feel insecure and has amplified my social anxietyawkwardness us tall dudes got it rough too i cant run for my life,0
"pool, swim, run speaking as someone who suffers from it who at years old had never kissed a girl and has made huge progress you need therapy but as you probably already know that ive been in your position of always being afraid that i will have nothing to say and things will go awkward and she will think of me as a weirdo the thing is unless you go and actually do it you will always feel like that you wont wake up one day and feel confident and feel like you could strike a conversation with anyone about anything however if you start doing the things you are afraid of you will see that your mind is magnifying the danger of talking with people x times not once in my life i regreted doing something that i was afraid to do because of my social anxiety after i actually do it i always think to my self it wasnt so bad or i actually had fun why avoid social events from work or family where dozens of people will attend there wont be a spotlight on you where everyone will look at you and judge you negatively the moment you enter the room socializing is a skill that needs to be practiced if you never go into a pool because you dont know how to swim you will never learn to swim but if you decide to go into the pool and practice eventually you will be a good swimmer in the begining it will be scary you may swallow a bit of water and stay in the border of the pool not going very far so you wont drown but if you keep pushing yourself to go deeper little by little the day that you can swim effortlessly will come the same serves to socializing you have to put yourself in situations where you will be forced to socialize and you have the perfect opportunity for that with that girl from work throughout the years ive wasted many chances of socializing and making friends because of my social anxiety as i said at years old i had never kissed a girl it just happened when i decided that i would not run from social situations as painful as they might be in the beginning today i can talk with just about anyone although im still not a social butterfly never will be and despite still being very anxious summarizing things will not get better unless you face the situations you are afraid of arrange a date with that girl it wont be as hard andor as awkward as you might think it will be it never is",0
bikes i have stutter sa and epilepsy while being an extrovert who loves cars and bikes i cant love myself because me myself blocks off what i love,0

bike im studying abroad where english is not the local language so i cant really get a normal job just cleaning and suchand i dont want to go back home i was thinking about dropping out and just working as a bike courier they dont get that bad wage here and try to invest into something with my savings i guess well see the degree is still at least years away and i dont have the motivation to stay at school also i always get anxiety attacks when i step inside a full classroom edit also i can fully understand why you couldnt get yourself to attend anymore it can get really bad,0
outside i have the exact same whenever im with my sister who im pretty sure is pretty cool you know and liked by a lot of people she tells me im cool funny fun and i am convinced but yeah just like you said as soon as i step outside it just all disappears,0
running if a community project existed that brought people with social anxiety together what would you want it to be like imagine an environment where you could learn and practice tried strategies to overcome social anxiety with other people who also have social anxiety a place where it doesnt matter if you stutter get mind blanks or say your sentences back to front conversations would be structured and designed to incrementally promote self awareness and expression the aim is to make whats meaningful yet uncomfortable comfortable through repeated exposure think of anything that you learnt growing up that was uncomfortable at first but with repetition became comfortable or tolerable thats the aim im working on a free of charge community project that drives change with people who experience social anxiety ill have to learn lots in the process and ill often be out of my comfort zone im some one who used to have debilitating social anxiety and only just recently started seeing the world in the light of possibility everything just makes so much more sense now the way i see myself the way i see others and the way in which i interact with the world once i have a tried and tested community running in my local area ill release the plans in full so that anyone anywhere in the world can start up their own free of charge community in their local area to help themselves and those around them so back to my question in title with my vision in mind what are some of the finer details that you would want present or any changes that you think are plausible or just what are your thoughts on the project theres no right or wrong ill compile and think about every answer provided im just an ordinary person reaching out to those who seek a better future with the intention of providing an access to possibility for them,0
outside is it possible for us to be rich and successful one day i mean uh we might have everything but lack the one thing actually needed to function normally in the outside word im just a univeristy student right now so people with sa doing jobs is every day dreadful i remember my mom forced me to join the student council back in middle school and it was horrible for me until i finally left it,0

outside omlll no the barber should be the one outside and im inside,0
run i avoid talking to teachersprofessors ever since i was a child i have always been intimidated by teachersprofessors i am not sure why but nowadays i mostly think its because i feel inferior to them like they have so many titles and i have none i am always afraid of asking questions for fear of sounding dumb and reducing my worth even further i dont know how to get out of that mindset this avoidance has done nothing but hurt me in the long run since i end up having to spend a lot of time selfteaching myself concepts i need help withdont understand very well while i my anxiety around teachers is not as crippling as it used to be in my teens i still struggle tremendously and the thought of approaching them to ask anything is terrifying,0
run thank god the people that run the institution im at right now dont care about participation grades and they have a mantra of learning is your responsibility so all there is are exams and projects,0
hiking friendship help hello for a little bit of background im m a sophomore in high school with depression and anxiety these people im about to talk about have been close friends with me for about a year tldr at end everything was going very well in the relationship with this group of friends throughout the summer currently late fall we would hang out often and would send each other snapchats frequently everything was fine until a week or so before school started i found out the six of them had a group chat without me and were face timing each other but not me naturally i felt hurt but i didnt address it just then then a couple days before the start of school i facetime one of them telling them how i feel alone and depressed they cant really handle this talk and arent too comforting jump forward about a month i find out they hang out almost weekly without me i try to schedule activities with them yet theyre always busy together at this point they are avidly talking in the group chat yet almost never texting snapchatting or face timing me whenever im with them in school they text in their chat i confront one of them well call them clara and ask why theyve been doing stuff without me and why they have a group chat without me their only response is that they havent been doing much without me and that almost no one uses the group chat anymore both are blatant lies forward another few weeks and theyve been closer with each other more and more additionally they are adding others to the friend group that im not particularly fond of or close with seeing this i ask clara if they want to hang out because i dont want our friendship to slip away she says sure and we end up hanging out however i was uncomfortable and unable to talk the entire time because they were all infatuated with the new additions to the friend group who unknowingly to me were invited this resulted in a very awkward hang out for me while they were all able to enjoy themselves as each week passes our school hosts another football game i ask each one of them if they want to hang out after and they are all busy despite this i hang out with them at the game and end up overhearing them making plans for after the game in addition several games i asked if they were going to the game and they said no yet i find out through other people or social media that they went together this type of thing happens often in the following weeks they have group hangs without me and do activities without me such as hiking or doing a k one day in school i mention to one of them in an offhand way that they shouldnt wear a specific shirt because it was somewhat revealing this was stupid of me i am told the next period by another member that my comment was hurtful to the directed member of the group i immediately text her saying im sorry she says its fine yet i still even now feel terrible as a result of this i start avoiding them a little bit to reduce the awkwardness and to let things cool down a few times i try sliding back in but they all leave and talk amongst themselves i ask clara why they distanced from me she said no one is distancing from me most recently i asked clara if she wanted to do anything for black friday clara told me that she was shopping to which i said that i wanted to go i took this as a sign she was busy and didnt want to do anything with me then i contact another friend well call her lois and ask if she is going shopping with clara she says she is i try invoking that i wanted an invitation by saying i want to go but she doesnt pick up just yesterday i was talking with one of the newest members of their friend group whom ive been acquainted with for some time on ps his name will be rob unknowingly he left his microphone on when he got a facetime from lois lois was hanging with clara and her brother and wanted to see if rob wanted to join them as rob was a new member to the friend group i naturally felt jealous and hurt that lois face timed him and that he was invited while i a long time friend wasnt their conversation continued on about the next day black friday they talked about how they felt bad that no one wanted to do anything with me rob mentioned how he wouldve invited himself to go shopping as opposed to what i did which was attempting to get an invite then lois invited rob to go with them for black friday at this point i felt incredibly hurt and while still listening on ps texted clara i asked her rather confrontationally why they didnt want to do shit with me and why they dont like me anymore to this she said she had no idea what i was talking about i told her i heard rob and lois on the facetime i brought up the other instances too about how they hang together how they tell each other things they wont tell me and so on i tell her it makes me feel terrible and depressed yet again they cannot handle the talk about depression and tell me that they get uncomfortable with me when i bring it up i asked again if they want be friends at all to which they said yes and that they cared for me deeply they said they didnt want the friendship to come to this point of discomfort just as i didnt they said ive been too interrogating and clingy which i see completely all the times ive asked about what they are doing and why they dont do it with me is clearly pushy but if i dont ask im not told at this point in the texting rob has been told by clara and lois that ive found out so he leaves me on ps clara says that things wouldve been better had i not been so clingy and questioning to this i reply that ill let them do their stuff and that im sorry we say goodnight and leave each other alone note other friend groups arent an option for various reasons tldr a friendship group of about a year has been adding new members that they are close with while distancing themselves from me i ask them why but they see it as interrogative and clingy i dont know how to maintain a relationship with people when attempts to do things together are seen as clingy and asking about whats happening in the friend group is confrontational i dont have other options for friends and i need to repair this relationship any advice is exceptional,0
"walk, horse first night on my own in my new apartment went grocery shopping at walmart i just got my own place closer to work i used to live an hour away i figured being on my own would help me out in a lot of ways i got off work at am and went to walmart to get stuff since i had no groceries and i hated it ever since my sa kicked off ive hated grocery stores and just stores in general walking around thinking people are looking at you and laughing the whole time and the worst part getting up to the register in front of everyone and putting your groceries up there and paying and getting the bags it sucks i thought walmart would be pretty slow at this time there was about people in the store and about behind me in line i let two women go in front of me since they had like items but the entire time i was in there i could barely focus on what i needed and even left without a few things like trash bags once i was up in line it really took off and i got shaky and hot and my heart was racing like a horse i got through it and hopefully this is progress and ill get used to the whole process and it wont scare me anymore i hope thats the case with everything in life now that im on my own being independent not just going grocery shopping point is sa fucking sucks hard even at am with hardly anyone in the store but i hope i keep going forward and making progress i wont quit",0
run online dating im a year old female and i have never dated anyone before i havent even had my first kiss i really want to start dating now but i have no idea how i would even meet a guy since i rarely leave my house and when i do go out its only to work target or makeup stores i feel at this point in my life it seems that online dating would be the only way for me to meet a guy is online dating worth trying or do most people just want hooks ups would guys probably run when they hear i have never dated or kissed anyone how else could i meet someone organically,0
run you have one life dude its definitely worth it the only price youll have to pay is discomfort but in the long run less anxiety less feelings of shame and embarassment more new and exhilirating experiences more sex,0
outside im in your exact same situation i also tried to make small steps in order to open myself to the outside world and be more social but is a slow process my main problem now is that every time i see my crush almost everyday at the gym all progress ive made disappear and i become completely unable to talk to her this puts me down big time and does not help me at all,0
mountain yeah ill check that terrence mckenna out tomorrow yeah i buzz of joe rogan and the guests he gets on yeah i see what you mean but certainly theirs got to be a way to get ourselves out of this loop hole i like to think positive like that anyway and their will be a silver lining somewhere and well what ever you choose to do i hope your at peace whether it be up at a mountain in the middle of no where as long as you feel you achieved something,0
bike i always go to the same petrol station to fill up my bike but always at weird time like am well the people recognise me now and i guess theyre so bored at that time so we actually have conversations and its such a good feeling i kinda use it to practice conversations too is that strange,0
walk how do i leave a room full of talking coworkers i work in an office and where i am everyone is near each other on their computers doing work at the end of the day around they all get up and start socializing i dont because i dont really know anyone that well and i wouldnt have much to talk about anyway my brother let me know he was ready to leave he got me the job and works in a different part of the building so i got up to go everyone was talking so i pretended to look at my phone and act as if i got a text from him that he was ready to leave i made eye contact with one of the people i know and said i was leaving but my voice was probably drowned out by everyone talking so i just walked out after standing there uncomfortably for seconds everyone is so nice to me so i dont want anyone to think im being rude by walking out i dont know how to leave properly do i interrupt people while theyre talking to tell them im leaving i dont have the voice to just go im leaving everyone im so quiet that most people wouldnt notice anyway any advice would be great,0
run yeah its easier to run off a script when talking to strangers but you cant reuse that script over and over with someone you know,0

"run, walk in the worst case i get a head rush and feel like im going to pass out i can also kind of go into a mode where i still hear people but kind of dont understand what theyre saying under more mild stress i slur my words cant stop blinkinggulping or stereotyped motions like stroking my beard or petting my hair or i become anxious and get an urge to run away from the situationconversation or at least take a walk mostly just get irritableangry though",0
golf im terrible at bowling not just regular terrible pathetic no pins gutterball each time terrible which makes it far worse it sucks that its the default work event if it was mini golf id at least not draw peoples mass attention and pity bowling is on another level of bad for me last time i ended up at a teambuilding bowling event my eyes started tearing up uncontrollably i couldnt stop blinking and it didnt help that the one girl i was really strongly yet awkwardly attracted to was there pretty much the one person in whose presence i could not help but act like a fool in front of anyway i honestly dont remember how i dealt with it the next day this was like years ago but im pretty sure i downed a pitcher of beer to deal with it while it was happening it at least did not end my career,0
"running, walk i have social anxiety am antisocial have add have high self confidence and am probably a sociopath im curious of what other people think of me on the outside im a shy quiet socially awkward and boyish looking year old yet i have high self confidence am antisocial and have many traits that a sociopath would have when i meet new people i focus on my voice how childish and soft spoken i sound i am unsure of what to say what facial expression to make how to act i look like a little kid coordination disorder makes me sometimes position myself oddly i cant problem solve with creativity which may sometimes make me appear dumb i have add but the kind where you hyper focus im too good at paying attention to one thing and it makes me narrow minded in situations with obvious solutions it often makes me appear less intelligent then i actually am im and pounds my left eyelash turned white my face is a bit discolored my jaw is too large my hair is probably messy i need braces am i breathing enough is my face red i hope they dont notice i always forget to smile i may seem cold i know if anything goes wrong theyll feel just as embarrassed as i do do they think that im cold and mean what if i come off as weird it will be over soon why do i care what they think in social situations im too critical of myself and cant relax its difficult for me to make the right facial expressions talk and worry about my other negative traits that could ruin the interaction or the persons image of me my insecurities can distract me and make me feel more nervous when im comfortable and unintimidated of the person im talking to im a different person however that doesnt make everything perfect i dont really have a real personality i have little to no empathy for anyone i dont know i have some empathy for those i care about most im not emotional nothing anyone says hurts my feelings i can easily lie no matter how terrible it is without feeling guilt as a child until middle school i liked to torture small lizards i wanted to buy a cat as an adult and torture it however i realized it was quite wrong and that part of me is disturbing i came from being a very emotional child to who i am gradually i am virtually the same if you compare me to who i was a year ago and so on no phases no sudden changes i always had anxiety for as long as i remember past years old i was never capable of real anger i always had complete control over my actions people said puberty and hormones would change me a lot but it was easy for me and changed nothing about me i have a strong will to live and have never suffered from depression even after all of this despite it running on my moms side of the family im intelligent have a high emotional intelligence strong intuition will power strength stubbornness and have no personality my voice tone changes so often my personality and attitude switching but only i notice i often feel blank like nothing my lifestyle would make any normal human feel pathetic and depressed but not me for the past years i have been home schooled instead of studying i cheat and pretend to be studying all day while in reality im playing video games not even games that could have a violent or negative influence on me thats how it is all day everyday and i dont have friends its quite foolish but i can get away with it and i only study for sats i even had a bunch of friends before i became homeschooled and i didnt miss them one bit im honestly unsure if i would even cry if someone i loved died im quite confused why i am me my whole life my chest was sunken inwards when i started growing quickly it became a large sunken hole i was insecure about it my whole life and got a dangerous and painful procedure to fix it recently my father has anger issues not physially abusive from my point of view hes not like fire anger hes like boiling water emotions he holds grudges his behavior or how he will react is unpredictable he causes scenes in public sometimes hes selfaware in some sense and tells me to never behave like him hes a good teacher and father and then hes not he threatens me of physical abuse these things happen rarely and thats because of how i act around him most of the time things are good and happy but i dont feel comfortable he doesnt truly take my comfort into consideration im always walking on eggshells and like him less as i get older he talks about my mother like shes crazy or like shes stupid my father has no idea how childish and messed up he actually is when hes angry he will scream and get in my face and try to hurt my feelings he will threaten me mock me he has no patience for stupidity he will make fun of me yell at me hell get angry if im not able to figure out a simple task it always happened when i was a little child but not anymore when i used to cry about how much i missed my mom he would yell at me hes selfish his feelings get hurt incredibly easily on the surface we look like a happy family and thats what he thinks but i only adjust my personality for him to avoid any trouble so those occurrences never happen my mom and dad split apart when i was a baby it was a terrible divorce and i ended up getting messed up as a toddler by my mother i had adhd at the time which turned to add and i would always try to look like a girl because of my cousin one year older than me who was a girl my mother is paranoid may have some sort of disorder and put me on medication however it made me go crazy i was getting brought to doctors left and right she was freaking out trying to figure out what was wrong im not sure what they gave me but it made me blink nonstop and act crazy she ended up giving me to my father who happily accepted me and moved away immediately i was heart broken that i couldnt see my mom and cried so much i missed her so badly and never got to see her thinking about how much i missed my mother even makes me feel like crying now he made me become better after quite a rough time and then my mom wanted me back this resulted in lots of fighting and i ended up trying to get my dad in jail in a desperate attempt to be with my mom again i was i was able to convince people that my dad had abused me and i ended up with my mom for weeks everyone was fighting in court and i was transported to some hospital with a bunch of crazy kids without parents to care for them my dad won with his intelligence and i ended up with him i rarely get to see my mom and half brother and i really miss them i see them every months for a couple weeks there is much more thats happened to me but these are probably the most damaging things i believe its possible that i have inherited my moms traits both my mom and dad showed early signs of a sociopath as children killing small animals abused in different ways but from what i hear about my mom i probably inherited her traits after all this time my dad is still the same but i believe my mom is a better person or has fooled me to believe so in hopes that i will end up with her if you met me youd never be able to fathom that what i wrote was true im a kind soft spoken shy energetic quiet intelligent weird serious goofy stubborn absent minded low energy person and more its like i cant act how i truly think im so much more than what i seem on the surface honestly everything wrong with me should cancel each other out im unsure of what i really have and what is emotional damage",0
run i agree with the first response it doesnt help you to overthink things and get selfconscious its okay that youre not that great at speaking under unfamiliar circumstances plenty of people need time to adjust to new things and in your case that just happens to translate into some speakingoutloud wonkiness try not to think of this as some kind of blemish or huge deal itll be easier to stay calm when you just go ah yeah im gonna be a bit bumbly here but fuckit it doesnt matter in the long run and its okay anyone who wants to make fun is a douche anyway its alright that this is difficult for you give yourself the room to breathe and work on this and improve overtime youre not failing anyone or any kind of test by not being as fluent in new situations as others so take your time and find what helps you get the hang of it loosening up will already lessen the anxiety and probably make the experience feel less negative which in turn makes next time go better build your confidence by rewarding yourself not by agonising over everything that didnt go perfectly yet,0
nature im not great at small talk or approaching people those i have success with fall victim to my neurotic nature,0
stream iv been suggested to try mindfulness a lot but when it comes to meditation its i feel the anxiety getting stronger instead of actually relaxing just today i tried a minutes mindfulness stream on youtube do you think its a matter of persistence is it normal that i feel that its making the anxiety worse,0
run a couple weeks ago i went to my high school graduation ceremony the ceremony was being held in a fancy venue in the middle of town i wandered the streets alone as per usual minutes before it began i felt so nervous about it wandering the streets was the only way to calm my nerves i felt so nervous about everything from my clothing to my loneliness to what my future studies was going to be announced as all killing me inside in my wander i went over to the bridge of remembrance which is a monument for fallen ww soldiers it reminded me of the situation in my head one which is helped me before i imagined myself as a ww soldiers standing up on a ladder ready to go over the top to certain death of the machine guns having to charge head on into the fear of social embarrassment below me there are some officers the officers informs me that if i were to run back they would shoot me for being a coward consequences for not going to the ceremony having to explain my absence to parentsteachers and potentially creating an awkward moment sad music from the soundtrack my favourite ww movie plays in my mind as i head back to the venue like the soldiers had to i must go too like they i must go straight into my fears i must successfully capture the enemy trench my fears and my anxiety it has to be done and there is no question about it in the end it wasnt as nearly as bad as i thought it might be but the whole thing was still soul crushing for me this may not be the thing for you but it certainly helped me,0
stream i stream on twitch in my spare time i can be funny and can speak clearly while streaming when im out in the world or at work im a nervous shy idiot its like i have personalities,0
run sometimes i feel worse yeah but more often than not im proud of myself for making the effort lowering shortterm expectations for yourself may help a lot more in the long run than holding yourself to unrealistic standards,0
pool have you any idea what sort of friends you would want it might help if you know what youre looking for since i highly doubt you want to be everybodys friend also people like us shouldnt be too preoccupied with having large groups of dozens of friends focus on one or two individuals of interest in a natural manner so dont try too hard look for genuine interest on your part and it will fall in to place shared hobbies and a bit of exertion help a lot i met my closest friend as an adult through playing pool every friday after lectures that structure helps an awful lot and as time goes on you diversify your activities,0
"walk, jog, running wow after you wrote this i did a little bit of reading on it i think you might be right this brought me to remember a time where i was walking her to the train station so she could go home i was just talking to her and i started to tell her how i felt as soon as i started she literally almost broke into a light jog basically runningspeedwalking into the metro station i never really could understand but now it seems to make sense we had facetimed twice also and she never showed her face i remember we added each other on snap and i asked her why she didnt respond once and she said because she is ugly lastly one time we hadnt talked in a couple days and she seemed a little down in the halls so i said i miss that smile of yourd and she cracked a smile and she said im bipolar i didnt think too much of it but it makes so more sense i feel really bad ive never been this sensitive in terms of caring for nobody i may have just come to the recognization that there is nothing i can do it pains me because some of her friends have said bad stuff about her calling her mental wreck and this guy pushed her i just feel so bad i may have to let this go for my sake cant ignore my own mental health trying to save somebody elses avoidant personality disorder cant be cured on right also being bipolar it sucks because we are so young but thank you so much boumboum for your insight and helpful comment thanks a lot",0
"walk, park because of the intentions of the little conversation if its asking for directions no ones obviously going to take that as harrassment someone walking up to me in a mall or park trying to pick me up without me having sent out any shown of interest would be pretty creepy yeah and to clarify socially retarded as in missing social cues not anxiety etc regardless i would probably have more good hits on tinder in a day than id get in a year of walking up to randos in the street if you want to flirt with strangers to go a club or bar",0
soccer too late now but you shouldve grabbed his arm and said something like yo whats going on man long time no see then hed basically have to react and if he says he doesnt know you then youre like yeah we were in a soccer team together its insert name what are you up to these days,0
walk that awkward moment when someones walking up to their car and you got your door wide open in their way lol whenever im sitting in my car with my door open to get some fresh air so its not a hot box in there and a car pulls up next to me or the owner of the car that was already parked next to me is walking up to open their car door i feel like me shutting my door makes it seem to them like im either trying to be considerate by giving them more room to get into their car or that it just seems like im annoyed that they got too close to me does anyone else feel that i dont want them to think that they were in my way or forced me to shut my door bc they came up to their car lol,0
soccer anyone else spend most of their days on their computer if so what are your interests in the internet world i spent probably hours today reading soccer forums watching and reading about soccer has become like my go to thing to pass the time its not even like a past time at this point i watch and read about soccer like i have some really personal stake in it even though i never played and know no one who plays soccer,0
outside social anxiety is a fear of social interaction with other people not necessarily fear of the outside world itself human interaction is necessary to function in society and when you have social anxiety and are unable to do that it makes functioning in the everyday world much harder so in that sense it absolutely is a disorder,0
outside it goes both ways sure if someone said im a psychopath and i obviously dont believe them it might still affect how i see myself as for someone to even consider me a psychopath maybe that means im a bad person etc this kind of thinking might affect how you see yourself even if you dont believe what they say sure but even if i totally dismissed it and it didnt affect me internally it would still have an affect on my anxiety i think the issue of how other people see you even if their views dont affect how you see yourself at all is still important to your anxiety as it affects how hostile you see the world if i believed everyone thought i was a fish my anxiety levels would go through the roof as even tho i know im not a fish them thinking that would obviously have negative consequences for me maybe ill worry someone tries to catch me and eat me ahaha its the same with people thinking you are a psychopath even if you dont believe it the world suddenly seems a lot more hostile towards you and in turn you become more anxious i think often people with sa see the world as much more hostile towards them than it really is because of how the perceive people view them even when they dont believe it themselves does my argument make sense sa is affected by not only how you see yourself but also how you perceive others see you although i agree they are usually linked its important because discovering your perception of how people see you may be more negative than reality which i think is often the case with sa is a good way of making the outside world seem less hostile and reducing anxiety you see where im coming from,0

running if you ever want to write a character on reddit that has a special use eg you can just put a before it also cant you up that gb allowance that seems incredibly low for a maximum and im sure increasing that would be less than running over your g limit good luck,0
run this is like the only thing i can ever give advice on haha go to interviews for places were you dont really want the job i know it sounds dumb but if you have the time its a great way to do a test run and its a bit of a confidence booster keep doing this until you can manage your anxietybody languagevoice a little better each time this way when you do go to that interview where you really want that job you will have had plenty of practice,0

walk so alone hello everyone this may be just a bit of a rant but unfortunately i have no one to speak this too and reddit has always helped me in the past ive battled with depression and anxiety since i was a kid and now being i recently moved out of my parents house into a apartment with my girl friend i love the aspect of having so much freedom but my girlfriend and i work complete opposite schedules this leaves me alone from pm pm everyday honestly im taking it horribly ive been having panic attacks and severe depression that only seems to be getting worse everyday my group of friends that ive had since i was little are away at college and everything they invite me to has new people im totally petrified of talking to new people in a group setting i have tried to make friends on my own but no matter what i cant have a conversation with any new people without walking away cringing about what i just said im totally insecure and i just cant seem to change that it feels like im at a breaking point and i wish this would all just go away thanks for listening guys have a good night,0
run too shy to stand up for myself all my life ive never been able to defend myself its like i just cant im afraid ill humiliate myself even more or something and so i tend to let people run over me a lot of it comes from bullying at a young age and it sucks that something that happened so long ago still has this huge barrier over my life i come from a family of strong people everyone in my family but me knows how to tell people off i wish i knew how to stick up for myself and not let people fuck with me but i dont how ive always been the sensitive one in the family always crying when people looked at me weird or said something offensive im and i dont want to enter the real world like this i cant imagine it,0
outside this is probably the biggest thing i still struggle with in terms of social anxiety its so easy to just not do the thing but i regret it of the time youve got to figure out some sort of hack to hold yourself accountable maybe its telling someone else of your plans so that they can text you that day to make sure youre going and youll feel silly reporting back to them that you didnt go maybe you can bribe yourselfif you force yourself to go you can order in a luxurious takeout as a reward definitely confirm with the sports team that you will be there and know that if you dont show up youll be letting them downsomeone else could have taken your place instead for me outside pressure is a lot more effective than internal pressure either way i think it means accepting that theres a decent chance it might suck and be totally uncomfortable but it also might not and either way its better to have gone that not to have gone,0
tennis please for fuck sake wear it why should you conform and do what everybody else does honestly do what you want cuz youre going to die one day and then youll think man why did i just not do what i want this is a great example of shameattacking where you do do something deliberately foolish and get people to judge you and show yourself you can stand it and you dont have to put yourself down try to think so what if people think i am weird at worst im just doing something weird by wearing this sweater but its not like i go around and only do weird things in all situations of life my fashion sense may be weird but that does not make me a weird student a weird son a wear reddit poster a weird movie watcher a weird tennis player and thousands of other things i dont have to label myself just because people do so,0
"walk, outside need advice on getting comfortable with college suite mates im a year old guy whos a sophomore in college last year i didnt make any friends but i was able to at least meet and sometimes talk to a few people on my floor this year i moved to a different dorm and the floor layout is not the best for meeting people its set up in a suite style w people per suite and suites per floor i have a single room and its around the corner and at the end of a small hallway leading off from the main lounge area so people dont walk by my room at all theres people across from me and next door but i havent talked to any of them i saw them when i was moving in days ago but i didnt say anything to them one time i came in the lounge and a bunch of people were in there but i got overwhelmed and just went to my room without saying anything as i was walking away i hear some girl say that guy didnt even say hi so i started off on the wrong foot by ignoring people so i worry that theyll think im stuck up or something because of that ive been avoiding people and its been working i have hardly seen anyone since i got here but i know the longer i ignore them the worse itll be with the way the floors are i know i have to make an effort to meet people but that makes me so anxious ive been too afraid to take a shower since ive been here and i havent brushed my teeth in the bathroom i just do it in my room and spit in the trash can but im going to have to take out the trash soon and i dont even know where the trash chute is because i havent walked around my floor at all i also avoid going to bathroom until i absolutely have to last night i had to go but i could hear peoples voices outside so i held it in until i was so desperate i was considering peeing out the window which now that i think about it is really hilariously stupid im feeling really optimistic about this year except my dorm situation as soon as i get off my floor i feel great but when im stuck in my room too afraid to go to the bathroom i feel like killing myself i have a couple friends and a girlfriend at home and cant do that to them but sometimes its so tempting i dont need to be friends with my floor mates but i want to introduce myself and be able to go to the bathroom take showers and do hw in the lounge comfortably does anybody have any advice on what i should do i havent talked to anyone in the days that ive been here and i need to change that soon before its too late at this point maybe i can lie and say that ive been sick or really busy and thats why i havent talked to anyone but its already close to the point where those arent good excuses and theyll realize that im actively avoiding them im currently skipping a class because im too afraid of that walk through the lounge to the outside so if this keeps up its going to take a toll on my academics as well sorry for the long post thank you if you read it all and i really appreciate any advice or suggestions",0
run social event review dinner with went terribly diagnosis i was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder in but i guess you could say i have had problems with social situations my entire life treatments i have had cbt on and off these six years and try and follow the self help guides when i am not in sessions i know its going to take a long time to see any progress to rewrite my thought processes and i havent given up yet however recently things have been getting worse and im starting to forget what its like to have a successful social situation in terms of medication i have been prescribed fluoxetine setraline and paroxetine none have made any difference to how i think act or behave in social situations event as part of my therapy i am encouraged to engage in social situations and so when this opportunity an evening out with four old flatmates came up i took it which i suppose in itself is some small victory i tried to enact techniques from my therapy such as if you cant think of anything to say then ask a question the problem was that as soon as i asked anyone a question hows the gf have you finished your masters etc they would give a one word answer and immediately turn back to the funny banter of the group i honestly could not think of a thing to say to add to these funny anecdotes my brain was whizzing at break neck speed but for some reason like always nothing would come to me it is honestly fascinating to me how things seem to automatically come to people line after line spilling out of them effortlessly my mind turns into a blank slate when everyone except one person went to the loo i tried to talk the remaining guy but he gave a one word answer yawned and then pulled out his phone i couldnt really think of something truly genuine and engaging to say chit chat wise like everyone else when everyone returned he quickly shoved his phone back in his pocket and became energetic again it is honestly shocking how boring i am all the while i am starting to burn up inside and get that anxious sick feeling overall apart from my run of the mill questions i have added nothing to the dialogue of the group for the entire night someone draws attention to my silence by asking if there is something wrong with me as i havent spoken when we leave everyone is given an emotional farewell except me who is given a curt bye understandable as i contributed nothing to the fun of the night when i get home i try and use my cbt to post process the situation ie he was yawning because he was tired not because i was boring him he was looking at his phone because he had received an important text they gave a curt goodbye to me because they were deep in conversation etc i still feel sick to my stomach though im not even sure why i wrote this i suppose as a distraction from doing something drastic because i want the anxiety to end i truly despise myself because my performance in social situations has destroyed every aspect of my life family friends relationships employment hell even shopping brings me anxiety this event is simply another to add to the pile of events which is every social event that has gone wrong keep going to these things my therapist says things will get better i smile when he says this but i know it will be easier to will blood from a stone,0

"walk, park, outside the story of me shitting my pants last night as ashamed as i am to say it this whole thing is true if youre interested in a story about social anxiety and shit literally then keep reading and i hope you enjoy im not the best writer so i pretty much have no friends i dont play video games either so all my social interaction basically just happens at work i have a few work friends but you know anyway one of my coworkers yesterday just asked me on a whim if i was interested in going out to the strip that night it was going to be him his girlfriend and her friend all three of them are hispanic and i dont know if this matters but my friend said the other girl is and originally from mexico and i dont know why but that is fuckin hot lmao anyway he said he thought hed ask me since ive expressed interest in latinas and she was going to be kind of a third wheel so i said fuck it ill think about it and text you after work not disclosing that a wailing fucking pit of fear just opened in my stomach later on he texts me saying the plan is just to chill and walk the strip since this other girl is visiting from socal and just wants to see the city at night at this point ive just been scanning the sa subreddit for situations similar to mine frantically clicking from post to post while the adrenaline surges through my veins like fucking hot lava i tell myself i just have to fuckin do it the worst that can happen is im a little awkward or whatever ill actually feel worse if i just completely bail out and sit around at home in my thoughts i ask him if i should just drive down there and park and meet them somewhere and hes like yeah that works around i get ready to go my hands are shaking as i put my contacts in my clean shirt i put on is already sweaty so i swap it for another after choking down on a miserable undercooked hot dog i get into my car and put on some tunes alright now for the good terrible part the thing is like i live in vegas but i cant even remember the last time ive been downtown let alone the strip so i decide to avoid the freeways and im heading down the street doing a straight shot for the strip im feeling a little better i got my music playing and im on google maps looking for a parking lot downtown turns out theres free parking down between the tropicana and hooters casino all of a sudden as im barreling onward towards certain doom my anxiety gives me a big ol bitch slap theres so many people down here groups of three four good lord five just out enjoying the evening i guess as im approaching the strip i notice all of the obvious tourists walking around and i realize they must be feeling similar to how i am right now i feel like im discovering the world for the first time so many tall buildings crowds of people using the crosswalks big signs with flashing images of famous successful entertainers im wrapped up in my head this is too much to handle all at once i find the spot where im going to park and miss the turn so ive got to go down and take the next right my anxiety is bubbling up inside of me the pots boiling and i feel its going to spill over my hands stick to the wheel as i inconspicuously make the turn into the lot if i dont do this my friend is going to tell everyone at work i bailed out plus this girl is expecting me to be there shit im a loser and these girls are probably really social im going to kill the vibe i know it what the fuck i park my car i feel as if i could vomit it wasnt the undercooked hot dog its the anxiety im regrettably familiar with panic and its distinct nausea im sitting there breathing deeply to try and cool the racing thoughts staring out my window my stomach bubbling my thoughts still racing i feel a fart coming lets all hang our heads in silence for this fateful moment i guess im ready to go i just have to do this lets fucking do this im going to do this im going to do this just gotta let this fart out and im opening the door alright cue sound of juicy fart oh god now i know this story might seem anticlimactic but let me tell you that in that moment my heart stopped and then sank to an unfathomably low place i looked outside and i watched the cars going by and the flashing lights and heard music playing from a club or a bar somewhere i didnt even bother texting my friend i kind of curled up so my ass was not directly below me moved my seat back a little and scooted forward igniting the engine while the smell of shit confirmed that was just happened really actually happened and thats basically it the drive home was horrible after i cleaned up i texted my friend and pretty much just told him sorry and that something came up although came down might be a more fitting description i dont work with him again until monday but i probably wont tell him what really happened i had to share it with somebody though lol it sucked but i felt kind of relieved both mentally and in my bowels i ended up making another hot dog but i cooked it thoroughly this time and i enjoyed the fuck out of it i guess the lesson is take a shit before you leave the house i guess thanks for reading and id appreciate any comments you have",0
running oh god that sounds awful i generally had to sit in the back row in college so i could escape if i felt my anxiety well up but ive never had an attack that bad while surrounded by so many people ive always managed to escape in time but obviously that is not always an option different people require different coping mechanisms but when i get that alleyesareonme kinda thing i find that counting exits and running through escape plans can help a lot to contain the attack,0

running anxiety and depression often go handinhand you feel like you cant control anything that is going on in your life and you withdraw from normal activity i was this way about years ago if you havent already and if it is possible for you to speak to a psychologistpsychiatristor normal doctor i strongly recommend it i told myself that i didnt need anyones help and i could fix myself alone but i was really just running from my problems and hiding myself from what made me anxious i had a break down and finally agreed to get help i think that without seeking that help i would still be in the same place certainly talking to someone isnt an instant cure it takes a lot of work and you have to be patient with yourself and be ready to commit to changing the way you do things its been years since i started putting in that work and i see a night and day difference it sounds like you really want to make a change but dont know where to start try opening up to someone about how you feel and dont be afraid to ask for help,0

"walk, running hate calling in at work i hate having to call my work and say that i cant come in i just dont feel that i have a good enough excuse to miss work the only times i call in is when i am so sick that i cant physically walk this week i only had to work monday and saturday on monday i was very sick and running a fever so i didnt feel too bad about calling in because i felt awful and could not get out of bed i was planning on coming in to work my next shift until i found out that my family was going to a wedding that day and didnt tell me about iti didnt have enough time to request like i am supposed to so i had to call in again it sucked i stressed over it all day because i thought it was a bad excuse and this would be my nd time calling out in a row well it went as expected i called my manager and said that i had to go to a wedding and could not work the next day but i did say that we should already have enough people working that day to cover my shift he said so you missed your last shift and now you are missing your next shift are you sure youre going to be able to make your shift after this one god i hated i cant stand missing work and i cant stand when people get mad at me im usually one of the most dependable workers",0
walk is anyone else anxious about events wayyyy in the future that may not even happen at all example im afraid to get married i feel like im going to throw up just thinking about walking up the aisle and the ceremony where everyone is staring at me also the reception where everything is supposed to be about me and just the whole thing i know that a wedding can be any way i want and i dont have to have a bunch of people but it still makes me anxious also am i even going to get married im and never had a boyfriend and i dont see myself getting one in the futureunless he is very determinedstraight forward because i tend to avoid guys i think like me so i may not even have to worry about that i have a sister and if she gets married im afraid she is going to ask me to be her maid of honor and then again i have to walk in front of people and even do a speech which i honestly think i would rather die than do that i feel bad thinking only of myself but not getting married also makes me anxious i already get questions from familycoworkers like why arent you dating someone and i never have a good answer for that and i think those questions will continue for my whole life if i dont get married and it will only get more awkward also im afraid of being lonely if i dont find someone i would definitely have a dogor dogs but i think i would need some kind of human interactionor maybe i dont,0
tree this is why i dont think ill ever go on a date this one time i had to drive this girl i was attracted to a few blocks to drop her off and i was so anxiousdistracted i almost missed a stop sign and slammed on the brakes and then nervously explained how thats the second time i didnt see that stop sign today and they should really make those things more visible so theyre not obstructed by tree branches and this was just a few blocks in a suburban neighborhood i cant even imagine driving downtown on a date and find parking in a city to go to a restaurant i probably wont ever get married alright george costanza moment of the day achieved,0
"outside, walk, park i went to the movies last night for the first time in over a year got done with work super early and hadnt seen rogue one yet because id been putting it off because i had no one to go see it with and was anxious about going to the theater alone but last night i finally went i was planning on going to an imax d showing but once id finally parked in the lot outside the mall i got so nervous that i couldnt bring myself to get out and i ended up just sitting there in my car for an hour every now and then people would walk by getting in and out of cars and every time i would look down at my phone and pretend like i was texting someone so i wouldnt look like some creepy dude just sitting in a mall parking lot at night finally i said fuck it and just went in to a regular showing which was minutes later box office was empty no one else in line ultimately no more than people in the theater which was very nice afterwards when i left the mall was literally empty one of the most surreal experiences ive ever had was walking toward the exit to get out of this place that normally causes me so much anxiety this place called a mall that is the epitome of fears associated with sa this place that is usually bustling with crowds of people going every which wayand it was just me when i got to the row of glass doors i stopped and turned around and just stood there for about seconds just taking in my surroundings gazing down the hallway still brightly illuminated by the lineup of shops with this soft orangegolden glow the sound of a vacuum cleaner somewhere and the ever so audible patter of southern california rain outside against the concrete out there in the dark it wasnt relief that i was alone it wasnt sadness that i was alone it was some new dreamlike emotion i dont think ive ever felt before in that moment suddenly it became so perfectly clear that i didnt have to be afraid of any of it none of this world had to be against me if i didnt want it to and if i wanted to i could do anything because i was free to do so then i turned and walked out the door while driving through the rainy streets i felt this lump in my throat like i was on the verge of tears and im not completely sure why i wasnt exactly sure how to get home but i didnt care and i didnt use my gps i just drove around until i got there i knew i would find it eventually but the entire time i felt somehow lost i couldnt tell if i was actually crying or if it was just rain dripping down from my head and even though i havent really felt suicidal since november i felt this strange desire to let go of the steering wheel and just crash or go park somewhere and walk for a long time through the rain and go lie down on the ground somewhere by myself and fall asleep and never wake up suddenly i just had this sense that this was the night this was it this was the time to finally do it i ended up just returning home and getting slightly drunk before going to bed and now everything is back to normal this confession has meant nothing",0
outside it just wont go away i feel like social anxiety is just sabotaging every aspect of my life in ways so subtle i cant control it whatsoever i can be in a conversation but there is always social anxiety completely ruining how i think and feel about whatever happens to have been said and i just completely fail to preform under the spotlight no matter how hard i try and theres no way to address it theres no way in a conversation to all of a sudden come out midway through it that its social anxiety that is behind the way im coming offpresenting myself i just have to live with it and just deal with the outside world only being able to react to a version of myself that comes off as boring stupid and negative where you cant tell when im making a joke fuck man i try so hard every day to get rid of this shit but it always has the most subtle yet controlling aspect over simply the kind of person i am it just wont go away i dont want to keep being meek but i cant be any way no matter how much i try to change the way i think or fake like im different until i really am the latter of which is a crapshoot strategy that has never worked for me my brain isnt powerful enough for me to pretend i am a different character for an extended period of time,0
running these thoughts are there for a reason i dont know what that means but the thoughts are irrational if a person truly said to themselves id like approval but i dont need it im a worthwhile person even when people reject me and when i fail or a mistake lets assume they believed that they wouldnt panic about going into a grocery store and they certainly wouldnt equate going to a grocery store as being the same as a wolf running after them andxb i definitely agree that people would be better off accepting their anxiety accepting their anxiety means changing their beliefs about themselves and their anxiety just like im saying my anxiety is uncomfortable but i can still live an enjoyable life with it it doesnt make me a worthless human being only a person with an unfortuante deficiency,0

nature uh not really i talked to one guy for the longest time thinking he was one of the few people at my age and then one day he mentioned oh im and i was like wat you dont look that old at all theres a lot of yearolds here and even yearolds at start but i just stuck to the handful of yearolds i found at first but as time has went i think people realize that the space were in together makes us kinda equally mature the big difference between me and yearolds is probably their careless nature about things regarding their future we have an entrepreneur course thingy that i was lucky enough to qualify for with a group and the yearold guy in our group was always like alllright ill meet up so we can get this over with and of course yearolds are still getting used to applying the term adult to themselves i think i hit before i was oh god i actually am an adult,0
walk a little in some situations i assume people are looking at me judging me so im very conscious of my motions when i think about walking it makes me walk awkwardly,0
walk two strangers laughed at me while i was on the verge of an anxiety attack tldr faced a huge social fear unsuccessfully talked to a front desk lady while getting increasingly anxious two women laughed at me in an elevator because i looked anxious this happened about weeks ago im years old and went on a small trip with my dad we got to our hotel and i was already a bit anxious because it was late and i dont really like being away from my mom sad i know so we got to our hotel room and i realized that there wasnt a shower cap and that id need to go to the front desk to get one my dad had gone out for a walk so i was all alone my overprotective parents made it so i get super anxious going places on my own without asking permission but after minutes of nervous pacing i decided to go i was so proud of myself in that moment for overcoming a huge fear of mine and acting like the age that i am cue more anxiety from talking to strangers i waited in line and was already shaking a bit then i asked the employee if they had a shower cap she said shed check she took a long time and the waiting made me even more anxious she came back and said she couldnt find one but that shed look in another room she comes back and tells me there arent any so i thank her and walk to the elevator now im feeling even worse because i feel bad for inconveniencing her for nothing i step into the elevator and two women in their s follow i hate elevators small spaces you cant leave with complete strangers i try my best to look like im not on the verge of a panic attack but i suppose i didnt look as natural as i thought i did the women stifle laughing and looking at each other of course my first thought is oh god theyre laughing at me because im such an idiot and then i remember reading something that said that people arent paying attention to you and are more worried about themselves weve all heard this right so i chose to believe that as best i could healthy thoughts no nope no as i walk out of the elevator and turn the corner i hear them burst out laughing oh my god did you see that little girl she looked so scared thats the funniest thing ive seen all day theres no doubt that theyre talking about me right then i burst out crying and quickly walk to my room wanting to lay down and cry well of course that cant be the end to this terrible minutes because my room key wont work now im standing in a hallway crying waiting for my dad to come back to open the door a few people walking by give me weird looks eventually my dad comes back and i go to the bathroom to cry and have a panic attack for the next hour i didnt really enjoy the rest of my trip because of this unfortunately well guess whos never getting confident and facing their anxiety again i dont know why i thought i could do anything social without fucking it up majorly i cant believe im two years from adulthood and cant even carry out basic social interactions,0
"outside, walk i cant study at all none of it fits the way i am i often feel like ive been born into a world that was made for everyone but myself especially with schools and such i just cant work the way its expected of me because thats just how i work and im just getting sick of it i nearly failed high school back in the day and now im on my way to study what ive wanted to for a while and the subject is interesting but i cant make it work in the structure constant group work assignments and deadlines remember to build up your contacts we have fridaylounge for socializing and i never show up because im chickenshit ive lived on my own for half a year now i dont have anyone i hang out with and its nothing but stress i talked to a school counsel about me having anxiety and she said i wasnt the only one who had some struggles and that its not wrong to be like that so thats great but thats not the problem the problem is how i cant live up to these tasks that i have right now i get them done just barely but they depress me and i have serious concentration issues i tend to be unable to learn during the actual classes because all my concentration is on the people and being anxious about it so here i sit in the middle of the night skimming through all the exercises i skipped because i cant learn when i sit in a classroom with other people and again im not interested in a homeschool solution or finding ways to enjoy this without people i crave being able to funciton with other people it pains me every day when i cant do it and i never feel satisfied and i have almost no moments of selfesteem from any of this its just completely exhausting sitting in my tinyass dormroom for days without going outside now depressing myself and not talking to anyone that keep walking back and forth out in the dorm or the kitchen man some days i wish time could just freeze until i was able to catch up to everything and feel ready for it",0
soccer for me it was a bad experience when i was younger i feel like i was a normal kid for the most part until i had to change schools in th grade i felt so left out and unwanted no one ever talked to me because everyone else had friends that they knew from the previous year eventually i made friends but not really my friends were people i talked to and watched them play soccer during break i was also made fun ofjudges indirectly like people would describe a person and make fun of them this person was clearly me so whenever i hear people laughing i always feel like they are laughing at me,0
runs my parents werent like that they noticed from a young age that i needed an extra push and always tried to help me get there for me i have a strong suspicion that it runs in my family another thing is i wonder if as children we are more observant and pay attention to when others fail and internalize their emotions towards what happened to them i have always been a watcher i like other people to go first to show me what to do and i pay attention to what others are doing in whatever situation theyre in,0

run i think the way to forgive yourself for the mistakes you made when you had social anxiety is to recognize that those failures were building blocks to what you are now they are a part of this better version of you now yes they were negative experiences but in the long run they contributed to your positive social development,0

tree hey there i used to be in a similiar spot i hated myself through my teenage years and couldnt understand how anyone could want to be friends with me let alone date me i was pretty lucky to still have friends at that time because my social anxiety was at its peak back then and i could barely sociliaze without having a breakdown since then a lot of things happened that led me to change how i treat myself one very important discovery was this the reason i was so afraid of people not liking me was because i hated myself that simple it didnt have anything to do with how they treated me but with the way i saw myself i was scared of them seeing past my facade and finding out what kind of horrible person i was inside the second discovery i made was how harshly i treated myself whenever i made a tiny mistake i wanted to hit myself and a wave of demeaning thoughts overcame me i then started to slowly distance myself from this default punishment system in my head and asked myself okay i just did that and feel horrible about it how would i treat a friend if they did eaxctly that would i hate them want to hit them of course i didnt be your own friend try to look rationally at your actions instead of letting your anxiety be the judge after a time of looking more rationally at my actions and treating me like a friend i also started to doubt that i was that horrible person those mistakes werent real ones just doorways for my anxiety to bust in and kick me down people didnt like my facade because i didnt have one they liked me for who i was and i could finally accept the signs of their affection be it messages smiles hugs compliments showing interest etc the next step was looking at real mistakes moments where i was truely in the wrong i learned to face those errors and stand up for it yes i did something wrong and i knew it was bad everyone makes mistakes everyone i wont try to justify my behavior and then i let it go there is no point in hating yourself for the rest of your life because of it dont deny it but also dont drag it along with you the past is in the past and all you can do is learn from it get better so you wont repeat those mistakes being confident can be scary i always pictured it like climbing up a ladder if you stand at the bottom nothing can easily hurt you but its also dark and cold down there if you start climbing up there is a chance that people will come by and try to shake the ladder or you loose your balance and maybe youll even fall down but up on that ladder the view is much better than at the bottom maybe youll be able to reach the branches of a fruit tree see a path that leads to your destination or just enjoy the sunshine on your face alright enough with the metaphors not hating yourself and having selfconfidence also gives you the ability to reflect on other peoples behavior towards you when i still believed that i was not worth of anyones affection i took peoples mean behavior towards me as proof i thought that people who treated me badly were in the right i automatically assumed everyone around me didnt like me because why would they it was like i had to first prove myself to earn peoples affection now that i dont hate myself anymore i have a totally different view people treating me badly doesnt mean i deserve it it can be justified but not necessarily and if its not justified then i have the right to defend myself i dont adopt their view of me as fact or as my personal opinion of myself no matter what you do there will always be people who dont like you no matter what you do so why concentrate on that when you can instead focus on those people that accept and love you for who you are,0
sun of course i have friends they just cant come over you know that thing where people are like allergic to the sun they have that all of them,0
run i had a similar problem in my first and last relationship it was also long distance the main difference was that she actually treated me like crap even though she treated me really badly my social anxiety and being stressed out all the time was one of the main reasons i ended it eventually that fear and stress outweighed the attraction i once felt for her and she wasnt open to talking through that sort of thing i still regretted dumping her for a couple months afterwards and had to constantly make lists of all the ways she had mistreated me to stop myself from going back to her despite the fact that i felt like i didnt need anyone while i was with her i got more lonely than i had ever been after i left it was a year before i started to think of it as purely a good decision if you break up with him just because of your anxiety although i know it seems like the best way to get rid of your stress right now i think youll regret it and see in the long run that it only made things worse the same thing will happen in every relationship from now until the end of time unless you find a way to trust him and talk to him about your fears if you talk to him and just spill this entire post you wrote on him whats the worst that could happen worst case scenario he leaves you then youre free anyway without any guilt and youll know for sure that he wasnt equipped to handle your social anxiety if he handles it well then youve made the first important step to having a relationship thats actually trusting and fun go for it and tell him the whole thing write down your thoughts and text or email it to him if you have to if you find that you cant say the words aloud,0
runs i was diagnosed with sad at age and im pretty sure it runs in my family i suppose i dont approach people often because im afraid of their judgement but since i know it will likely be negative anyways i dont care what they think if that makes sense i actually tend to more anxious around people i know think highly of me lol i am anxious around people who i believe dislike me but dont care as much about their judgement but since i know most people likely think negatively of me i dont care about their opinion,0

run this is just a general tip i like to give people asking this question its a very general tip and i have no youtube success to back it up dont even give a damn what people want to watch make videos on topics you care about things that you want to talk about thats whats gonna make you happy in the long run and will arguably add more essence more personality to your channel not catering to the masses now that i think about it that advice also sorta fits social anxiety,0
"walk, mountain my doctor told me when i started taking it that a lot of people who go on ssris only end up taking them for a year or a year andahalf basically just long enough for it to get their lives on track and point them in the right direction i didnt really expect this at the time but its exactly what ended up happening with me i was on mgday for about months then the effects started to wear off as i became adjusted so my dosage was increased to mg i did that for another months by the time id been on them almost a year i felt like i didnt need them anymore im not sure what the scientific term is but ssris arent a per use drug theyre more long term it takes a few weeks for them to build up in your system before they take effect so after youve gotten used to their effect it kind of becomes invisible you know like at a certain point you can no longer distinguish between the effects of the meds and your own thoughts for me at the end of that year it wasnt im content with my life right now and i feel so much better because of these meds it was just im content with my life right now and i feel so much better i was so much more confident and hopeful in the future and in my own abilities that i kind of forgot that wasnt the true me or at least the normal me i didnt want to have to rely on meds to live a fulfilling life and i felt confident enough in myself that i could handle any returning anxiety on my own going forwardor that i was at least willing to tryso i said thats it medication held my hand and walked my partway up the mountain but now im ready to tackle the rest of it myself i guess it was sort of like being intoxicated once you start drinking your inhibitions dissolve away and you gradually stop giving a shit about things that normally worry you youre able to actively interact with people and everything is awesome and you dont care because youre as light as a feather youre much more confident now and you rejoice when you realize that you are in fact capable of being nonanxious and socializing with people normally everythings fun and great then once you sober up youre back to your old disappointing regular self i guess what im saying is i thought the feeling of being drunk would last even after the alcohol left my system because i thought it was me who was doing all those things but i was wrongit was the alcohol on a related note youre not supposed to drink while on ssris tldr i thought id won but it was just the meds tricking me into thinking id won",0

park i got my cars state inspection done one of the sources of my social anxiety is not knowing what to do and being afraid of making mistakes i kept putting off getting my car serviced because i wasnt sure how the process was supposed to go do i park and tell the person inside what i need done do i pull up to the garage basically my fear would be not knowing what to do and having someone judge me like ugh who doesnt know how to go to the mechanic i did tons of research and checked the auto places out on google maps to see the layouts and any instructional signs there might be i found a place with a sign that said to just wait for an attendant then they took care of me from there i felt really good about getting it over with and now i know how to get my car serviced,0

outside do you also avoid meals in public this is a problem ive had for many many years i avoid eating outside like the plague because of my fear that people will think i have bad manners im a bit of a shutin so i always eat inside of my room i tend to decline invitations to go out to eat and when im a guest in someones house i pretend like im not hungry even if im starving i just cant help it and i feel like i miss so much because of it im also a bit of a klutz so i cant use a knife and fork properly i just feel so bad about it,0

running i was similar when i started college male for most of my life ive pushed people away thinking i wasnt good enough i ended up with no friends and i still dont really have any th year but i am getting treatment and getting closer everyday my two biggest mistake no treatment and staying in my comfort zone go to therapy take their advice seriously actually find a therapist that your comfortable with its important in fact your college might offer freecheap therapy sessions like mine does dont knock medication but dont jump at it either keep trying and dont give up figure out what you find fun what interests you find people who do that even if you switch to something else later or you dont click with the group thats just one step closer to finding what you do like failure is a teacher not an enemy keep trying new things whenever you can and above all remember youre not perfect and thats ok youre going to make mistakes meet people you dont like and sometimes waste your time just do your best and that means taking time for yourself too not just running from one event to another one step at a time youll get there believe that,0
sea yeah the constant pangs of being hit with memories of me fucking up socially from when i was like years old to an hour ago are like minutely punches to the gut and i agree with the part about selfawarness its just that i dont think society values selfawarness as much as it does the traits that were missing things like assertiveness sociability not having to experience horrible feelings everytime you have to interact with a stranger selfawarness is undervalued by a culture based upon interacting with a vast sea of others with the primary motive of selfinterest i have a really hard time asserting my will on to others but have no problem spotting when its being done to me even if i can reliably spot it i usually end up going alone with it because of fear and stuff,0
outside to me its either being trapped in your home and head with negative thoughts about your social past and future or exploring the outside world still trapped in your head and being shattered by negative thoughts about the things you do and the people around you in the present,0

running i think keeping a running cbt worksheet might still be good for you its all about recognising negative thoughts and then coming up with rational alternatives you dont need to actually believe the alternative you just want to recognise that there is in fact another way to think about things the dysfunctional thought record on this page the second one i think its ideally suited to social anxiety the main thing i hate about counseling is that therapists dont seem to understand that its nearly impossible to out of the blue start thinking differently what the thought record does is it helps you recognise an better alternative thought but by repeatedly recognising it and creating a better alternative you start to strengthen that thought pathway in your mind eventually you want it to be automatic its like youre an athlete that needs to train a million times take that shot from the three point line over and over and over again in order to make sure your throw isnt off anymore the first time going to make the shot you might feel paralyzed but helped along on how to do it perfectly youll be able to do it that isnt to say that purely cognitive therapy is effective however in order to make meaningful progress you need to start doing adaptive behaviors which the cognitive therapy hopefully helps people do joining a club is the cliche example but joining a gym taking a more social job taking a class where you have to interact with others volunteering or taking up a sport are all good opportunities to practice social skills you can know in your mind exactly how to throw a three pointer but unless the opportunity to practice is there you wouldnt be very successful if thrown into a game social anxiety used to be called social phobia and a lot of the tactics employed in treating phobias is also useful creating what they call a fear hierarchy and working from what bothers you least to what bothers you most should help get rid of a lot of fearanxiety for example if you were afraid of tarantulas and you had to live with two of them loose in your house you would eventually lose a lot of fear you mightve already known they wouldnt hurt you but repeatedly seeing them and experiencing no negative effect helps strengthen the spiders are harmless part of your mind the main thing is to take baby steps and have support there when something challenges your ability to continue i hope this wasnt just a useless rant but i hope you can see that there are a lot of ways people can help you and even a lot of things you can just keep in mind by yourself i hope you have a great day,0
park anyone else gets more anxiety filled around men if theres a man cashier i get more anxious to checkout and if theres a man waiter i get more anxious to order i dont know if its because im a year old female and its only natural to be more uncertain and uncomfortable around the opposite sex or maybe i subconsciously know that men judge women for every move they make so that makes me nervous you know like say your trying to parallel park and if i women was directing me id feel comfortable but if a men was i would be feeling so uncomfortable cause id be thinking omg he probably thinks im a stupid little girl who cant drive but my best friend who is also a female saids she gets more anxious around other females cause she feels more judgement but maybe thats cause she judges females more so idk do any guys feel more uncomfortable around other men let me know what do yall think,0
golf ok so day three i didnt do it yesterday because i didnt have much time with work i chose to make todays challenge start a conversation with a stranger because ill have to stay in the situation longer like the last two challenges lasted only a few seconds in each encounter i was at the grocery store and saw this older lady buying some kinda natural dog food i went up to her and asked her what she thought of it it actually turned into a min long conversation about all kind of animal stuff it was pretty interesting actually i was only a little nervous at first but after the first few seconds it was fine i decided to do another one so i was at the mall and saw this mini golf place i went in and started talking to the girl that worked there about mini golf like asking questions and stuff it went fine and i wasnt too nervous at all one of the things i worked on more today is body language i usually have pretty closed off posture when i do these changes shrugging shoulders and all down to go,0
"walk, run so this morning i had to go to a bank in a mall most shops dont open until but the mall doors are open from around i think i got there at and decided to just wait the minutes for one of the anchor stores to open rather than walking all around the building to find another entrance the bank was located right next to the store as im waiting there i get typically anxious because im wondering if the other people around me are employees waiting for their store to open rather than customers like me i figured theyre wondering why this idiot doesnt just go to the main entrance thats already open anyways at the anchor stores metal shutter door thing starts going up it doesnt go up all the way but people start entering the store i pocket my phone and follow the crowd ducking under the partiallyopened shutters im near the end of the store about to go out into the open mall when a woman starts yelling excuse me from somewhere behind me now ive developed this bad habit of ignoring strangers that call out in public because idk its never my attention theyre trying to get and social anxiety makes me feel like an idiot when i turn around only to see them signalling for someone else so i continue walking as the woman keeps yelling her voice is getting increasingly shrill and that makes me more curious than anxious to find out who the hell shes yelling at and why we arent open yet you cant be in here i look around and see that everyone else around me kinda looks like staff and realise that ive fucked up im literally steps from getting out of the store and into the mall but instead i turn around and start walking back to the shutters as i near the woman to pass her she loudly says im calling out for him and hes just ignoring me and walking like he owns the place then sucks her teeth i dont say a word i just ducked back under the shutters and walked around to the main entrance like i shouldve from the start thankfully i got my bank work done without many problems and left of course because i didnt want to run into anyone that had witnessed the scene i had to walk all the way around the to the malls main entrance again rather than just take the shortcut through the store like usual i guess this is my life now",0
walk i spoke to her today a few weeks ago i met this girl in my college biology class we met because she and i were the last two to find the classroom it was the first day of class and when we walked in she asked if i wanted to sit next to her to which i of course said yes this made me feel special and since then i have yearned to get to know her better we spoke once since then when she said something to me but i had never had the courage to start a conversation with her yesterday my counselor challenged me to say something to her and gave me advice on how to go about it today i had biology with her and my plan was to walk in and as i sat down i would casually say hey how are you doing its simple casual and calls for more than a yes or no answer i got to class early i walked in filled with courage but as soon as i got close to her all that courage drained from me and i instead just sat down at my desk and felt defeated i then got up and took a short walk in the hallway to psyche myself up to try again i did and again i failed to utter a word i tried once more but again failure defeated i tried to think of ways to salvage this then i thought of an idea we had an assignment due in class that day so i took it out and looked for an answer i wasnt really sure about then i leaned over and said excuse me but i got x for this question is that what you got she responded by saying something along the lines of no actually i got this and gave a short explanation as to why i said thank you and gave her an answer to a question she didnt know and that was it i had successfully completed the task i had longed to do for weeks now after the class was over we went to the front of the class to hand in that assignment and she asked me for the pencil i was holding to write her name on her paper i gave it to her and when we left she said i was nice and then said see you on monday and we left i just wanted to share because this is a pretty big accomplishment for me considering after a year and a half in college im pretty sure this is the first conversation that i have initiated with another classmate and it went better than any of the many many possible scenarios that i played out in my head beforehand for the first time in as long as i can remember im actually not all that excited for the weekend because i cant wait until i get to see her again on monday,0
"run, cabin my dingy house makes my social anxiety skyrocket my house was built in the s so you can imagine its very run down there are spots on the wall that are broken and damaged in every room the paint is chipped in countless areas the kitchen floor had to be ripped up and is currently uncleanable the cabinets are broken the floor is squeaky theres stains on the walls and countless over things this leaves me feeling super insecure i so desperately want to invite people over but im so uncomfortable when they do because frankly its embarrassing im only the house is owned by my grandparents who are moving back in after i move out and theyve told us not to replace anything because they want to make those decisions how do i get over the crippling anxiety that people are judging me and my house any advice helps",0
running its the same for me but i think i know why its because at work for one im getting paid so i just have to force myself and also im kinda being fake ive mastered asking people so how are you guys or what are you guys doing up here or simple stuff cuz ive seen other coworkers do it and usually its not too hard to get past before running in the back and doing something to recover from just socializing also i have a fake smile and fake being ok i tell myself over and over its fine i work at an ice cream place,0

outside you have to realize she is also high and not in a sober state of mind either if you even said anything weird shes probably not even going to realize or think much of it plus if you dont have a high tolerance and are able to get super high everyone starts to say dumb shit i doubt you said anything weird anyway you really should just straight up text her and ask if you said any dumb shit and just say you were super high and cant remember it too well if she says yes then just blame it on not smoking in years weed can sometimes have some weird reactions it can make very social people have anxiety i just smoked with a friend that hadnt smoked in years he smoked too much and he literally collapsed and wasnt conscious for about seconds and once we got him in a seat he immediately got up and said get away im paranoid he then went outside and laid on the ground and this guy is a real chatty normally,0
run yeah thats still fine though much better to do that than just say youre feeling anxious as saying that in the long run will have you up at am thinking why the fuck you said that as now you will think that they are thinking you are weird so when in doubt just lie nice one,0
runs i usually make my friends order my food and they have no problem with that since they know what the situation is somedays are better than the others where you feel less socially anxious and actually take action but its rare i dont think you should push her into uncomfortable situations since that leads to panic attacks how about warn her before putting her into a situation and ask how she feels about that certain situation always make sure she knows you got her back and youre there to push her out of a situation if it goes wrong most of my friends also dont deal with social anxiety but sometimes they do get inconsiderate and i end up having a panic attack i know youre trying your best to keep up with the whole thing but pushing someone with no support is never the answer were already socially anxious so being in an unknown situation where it involves communication makes things even worse hope this helps and hope youll find a common ground with her but dont blame her for her actions social anxiety runs our lives and you cant escape it easily comfort zones are very much needed,0
run i can see how it could be negative if you get as big as all the entrepreneurs that you can name off because theyre basically celebrities and role models and people will always try to misconstrue them like when they made elon cry a normal entrepreneur usually isnt that maybe you can explain how its negative entrepreneurs run businesses they can be small being only be employed by yourself or they can be as big as amazon its not something every single person should strive for but it should still be a goal,0

running for me this is pretty weird because it changes sometimes i find that being sleep deprived does make me less anxious in general and too much caffeine makes me more anxious but it all depends on amounts too ive done a little research on this basically when youre tired your brain slows down on the other hand if you drink too much caffeine your brain speeds up someone who has a tendency to get anxious would be affected by this as their thoughts might race and contribute to the anxiety similarly a tired brain doesnt work as fast and therefore might be less anxious however i have also found that for some people a sped up brain process also means less time for consideration some people with sa including myself have a problem where they arent impulsive enough with their speech they think something and instead of just saying it like a lot of people do they think about it too much until its no longer relevant i often think that people with sa have he opposite problem of people who have no filter we filter it too much afraid of getting judged and what not for me if i am sleep deprived this lessens my anxiety in situations where i have to do a presentation in front of groups of people or go to an interview or a new class or something of that sort things that bring out strong symptoms like a racing heart or sweaty palms if i were to drink caffeine i would feel so much worse for everyday interactions however caffeine or simply enough sleep makes interactions where i dont necessarily experience physical symptoms better if im hanging out with a group for example and im tired ill tend to stay isolated and i wont really say things that come to my head but if i am more awake and my brain is running faster there is less overthinking and i have more energy to open my mouth and speak up i dont know how much of this is true but this is my experience and the information ive found it makes sense to me as well,0

"outside, soccer you would go outside at least every day because you felt like it and go shopping wherever you wanted maybe practice some kind of sport or music without caring if people think you suck etc i actually know someone who is a real coocoo but the coolest thing about him is his absolute obliviousness to what other people think hes the most unsporty type ever and he was a total awkward recluse the year i met him but i recently saw a picture of him where hes proudly posing with a soccer team and i was like wut he plays soccer now and i never imagined that he was at least as horrible as me back then like he couldnt even pass the ball across the field without losing control of it but now hes exercising it and playing in teams way to fucking go i say wish it was me but it motivates me to attempt things i thought were lost causes",0
horse yeah thats kind of what i mean its going to take time yeah of course we all do to a certain extent i dont know of anyone who wants or loves getting rejected by other people a person who truly completely doesnt care about other peoples opinion has other life problems of their own socially anxious people like us means that the fear has gotten so big that it begins to or already has affected our normal functions in life and thats not healthy i would take advice from non sa sufferers with a grain of salt qualified doctors might be a different story they may have great intentions but they cannot truly empathize with something they have never experienced before thats not to say everything they say is horse shit but if it resonates for you great if it doesnt thank them for their goodwill and move on if youre not terribly in need of money consider just taking a short break for a while also getting some professional help i do not know the details of your circumstances but i think this will be beneficial somewhat also perhaps look into getting involved in some yoga meditations etc things that would probably benefit your psyche,0

"runs, walk, run m am i missing something this is probably gonna get buried but whatever soim a high school freshman my family isnt very social but rather reserved social anxiety also runs like a mofo in our genes so you can tell where im coming from as a result i grew up to be kinda antisocial and only went out with my friends once or twice in the past mainly in middle school pretty much i was destined to be a tacit pakistani engineer that has a six figure job and a virginity reserved for an arranged marriage at now ive been really trying to escape my shell but its been backfiring as if im missing a tooth in the key or some other poetic shit like today i was walking out of a bathroom stall only to encounter a group of guys huddled up i said hi and they looked at me as if bigfoot just took an epic shit and said umlets get away from him and darted out when i finally develop the courage talk to people i always come across as condescending and caustic which is exactly the opposite of how i want to sound this causes people to avoid me like im invisible when i try to speak in a softer voice im completely inaudible and my voice becomes a background hum followed by what assuming that anyone is actually listening when i introduce myself im always awkward no matter how much confidence im trying to feign if the stars align and someone does respond its usually along the lines of umwho is this dude and why is he talking to me the words always come out wrong or as some dumb incoherent shit every time during a conversation my mind just goes blank like a sheet of copy paper talking to girls as you can see is a nightmare i want to connect with people but every time i consider opening my mouth im afraid ill screw up and end up offending them or being labeled creepy as usual if i dont talk to people same thing im seen as an arrogant douchebag i cant even smile genuinely my mind is always convoluted with random ass shit and what other people think whenever i do smile people think im high and run away if i dont people get intimidated i get the whole eye contact thing yadayada but whenever i apply it the convo becomes so mind numbingly uncomfortable that i stumble on my words i used to attend therapy but to no avail my therapist couldnt fathom why i had social anxiety she dismissed it with oh youre fine theres nothing to worry about theyre just people now im medicated still has no effect am i a lost cause",0

sun nearly the worst part about this for me is having to put up with people saying theyre tired of the sun or glad its finally getting cooler i freaking hate the fall and even if in concept i hate winter more fall represents the furthest point from summer for me which brings on all sorts of anxiety i make a point to live in socal which means we typically get summerlike temps through about november anyway can sometimes be the hottest time of the year but even here people complaining about that and wishing it would get cooler seriously fills me with rage i get they arent trying to be insensitive and dont really know what i mean when i say i hate the fall but it really does feel like theyre dancing while im getting more and more miserable the first anxietybringer is back to school ads too freaking early in july even then halloween ads etc also means i have to put up a face for my family which i dread thanksgiving gatherings etc fall pretty much always coincides with me being at the amplified depths of whatever sort of despair im in just for being itself,0

run well you definitely arent alone with that one id say most if not all the people on this sub will relate to this but know its easier in the long run to push through it and still go to those parties even if it feels shitty getting professional help while you keep up that exposure would be a great thing to do and trust me you dont want to go down the isolation route and cut yourself off from all those people itll make it incredibly hard to come back from that and itll quite literally ruin your life for the future trust me i went down the isolation path now im really going to have a hard time working my way back into life and will waste a lot of years trying to do it just push through it get help and dont do anything stupid such as self harm like i did and youll make it eventually,0
"outside, walk, bike i cant ask strangers for help i went to a gym yesterday for the first time and when i entered i sat down in the waiting area cos no one was at the reception it was just so awkward waiting outside and all these people walking past you eventually i go inside and i dont know how to use the treadmill the guys next to me know how it works but i just didnt have it in me to ask so i use the cross workout machine and it goes well after i finished i wanted to use the bike machine but theres a mirror in front of it and everyone can see you so i just leave i really dont know how i can ask people for help and get rid of this social anxiety",0
swim i was in your place a while ago and have come leaps and bounds but this isnt about me its about you stop drinking this is likely what you are doing to either deal with the anxiety loneliness or boredom maybe something else if you rarely see your friends and drink often i assume it is by yourself this is causing you to stall andor backpedal in life drinking without celebrating something when it is in excess is a cause of you doing nothing for yourself if you feel you are boring ask yourself what makes someone interesting it comes to the way they think their experiences and the way they act these things all tie into one another nobody is inherently boring but you have to experience life to add things to your armoire of activities that become your stories and in turn you you have to be doing something and you wanting to be doing something with yourself is already a sign of your growth you want it but you have to want it bad enough to the point where you are not going to stand for anything but getting what you want start reading if you arent doing something interesting start reading about something interesting this will add to your ability to talk about things and will make you start to think about new things and you might learn a thing or two if you dont have a hobby try to find one you feel boring because you arent doing anything literally just try to do anything whatever it is just try you have to make an attempt to progress in life in any way or else you will feel stuck in a rut motionless dull and hopeless life has a strong current but those who swim upstream are the strongest,0
outside today i realised the root cause of why i keep spiralling into the anxiety pit no matter how much i try to improve im sorry if this is the wrong place to post this but i need help and im not sure where to go if this post doesnt apply here then i apologize warning long post im spiralling very hard right now i think some of the worst experiences ive had with anxiety and depression was when i felt like i have no control over the decisions i make today i feel that way and its killing me on the inside honestly most of the time im proud of myself okay i have come such a long way from having panic attacks about talking on the phone to actually being able to have small talk with someone normally most of the reason why ive been this way before was because my parents over sheltered me to the point where i was not allowed to go out with friends or talk to people my age outside of school i was suddenly thrown in the deep end during college and somehow managed to survive my mother coddles me a lot its coming out of a place of unconditional love but sometimes it just feels so so suffocating i have to talk to her atleast once every two days or she says i dont have time for her or im making her sick with worry when im staying away from home she worries about the simplest things like the fact that its cold outside and suggests i dont go out at all just because its a little nippy she often sends me snacks and other things through people who travel to and fro from my hometown to the city i live in i hate it so so much bec the idea of using people like this gives me unending anxiety and makes me feel really bad things like shame and despair and i feel terrible about being in their debt i tell her every chance i get that i know whats best for me and i do not need certain things from her and whatever i need i will ask for unabashedly she says yes and does what she wants anyway because she thinks its for my benefit the feeling of never being in control of some decisions but being forced to bear its consequences is just so stressful it does not make me feel good i feel worthless and incompetent and hate talking to these people even more because it feels like i have an agenda when im grateful to them currently im on a solo holiday trip in london ive been planning to go and see this lovely city ever since i came to the uk two months ago but the moment i told my mom about it she called all the people we know who live close to london and made sure meet them and also gave them snacks and other luggage to give to me my plan was to relax and get away and see the city i didnt want any baggage but here i am two days in london and i havent seen anything except train stations distant relatives homes and awkward smiles ive been grovelling at them all this while for taking care of me and cooking for me and im very grateful trust me i am but i just wanted to relax on my own man why does she never let me take decisions why do i have to be portrayed as someone who has no prior planning when all these plans have been pushed onto me by someone else why doesnt she never listen never being heard hurts especially from someone who brought you up with utmost love my mom is not the healthiest person telling her all this in the way she understands guarantees that shell get hurt in the process so i have to eat my words and bear with it she wont listen to what the problem is but will only feel bad which makes me feel bad bec im coming off as such an ungrateful spoilt brat im sick of doing other peoples bidding because of social expectations sometimes it all feels like too much way too much i keep going farther and farther from home to test how much more control i can get over my life but every time im reminded that im just a somebodys dear daughter nothing more,0
camps help im scared of getting my first job so im years old and male and i just graduated from high school in june of this year i have diagnosed sa and adhd which were both diagnosed when i was young im planning on going to college starting next september but until then my parents want me to work part or full time the problem is having an actual job is one of my big fears and ive only done volunteering for kids camps up until this point the only places hiring around me are grocery or department stores but im really scared of what they will ask of me and their expectations ive been putting it off for a month now but i need to send out my resume very soon if i dont want to get in some serious trouble please help thanks,0
outside gamings out for me right now because my pc is quite old and i dont really use social media outside contacting friends on messenger reddits great but i dont live in the usa so most interactions will likely stay online but maybe its a nice starting point in learning how to break through this wall of anxiety,0
running stop running from it it only rewards bad behavior at the very least embrace it,0
"run, running some general tips which can be helpful hey guys its been a while since i posted last time here ive known consciously about my anxiety for over a year now and ive done some things in regards to it so yeah here are four tips that have helped me so far most of your anxious thoughts are over exaggerations understand that this alone deserves a separate post if you ask me when we have anxious thoughts we tend to over exaggerate things we think that by making one mistake at work well probably get fired or think that if someone speaks to us in a more pissed off tone then they probably hate all of our being we even might have thoughts about our own anxiety what if i have the worst case of anxiety what if i become bipolar or schizophrenic what if my life has been already messed up and its too late for me this tip is the easiest one since you probably know all of this already without me telling you this but a little reminder of this is good since it leads us to start questioning these exaggerated thoughts so lets say youre a guy in your s your confidence is shit and you suck at dating so you have a thought of downloading tinder in hopes that youll score with some girls and then the thoughts start flooding in what if im ugly what if i use a filter to make myself look more handsome but if i meet a girl irl shell see how ugly i am and run away what if the girls perceive me as a creep what if i match up with a girl see her irl but be boring as fuck and she sees thatwhat if i dont match with any girls there sir you got yourself a situation here so what do you do you start off by asking questions to yourself am i truly ugly before saying yes i am think about it there are people who are truly ugly but still score in the dating world have friends and have people who care about them whats so scary of being ugly im sure that youre not that ugly as you think you are since this is an over exaggerated thought but even if you are what of it will you die no will some people like you yes will some people not like you yes guess what even beautiful people are like that they too have people who like them or dont like them but what if people avoided you because of your ugliness is that true tho i personally avoid people who have ugly personalities not ugly faces wbu have you ever heard a sentence like that dude is so ugly please dont invite him over i personally havent but ive heard sentences about people having ugly personalities for which they are avoided but anyways you get the point or at least i hope so start challenging these thoughts the more you do it the little these types of thoughts will have power over you the issue that many people have is that they give ears to these thoughts as tho they were spoken by god himself why where are the proofs for these thoughts if there isnt any proofs than what on earth are you doing following them dive into feared situations oh boy this oven gets hotter by the second this one was and still is one of the most hard tips to follow its okay when i write about this while im in a calm situation but what am i gonna do if im in a feared situation in my case i start panicking and praying to some deity of inner peace to make me chill as fuck but as you already know that doesnt work the more selfconscious you are the more freaked out you are and the more freaked out you are the more these exaggerating thoughts that your ugly or that people will think poorly of you start to surface so what do you do whatever you do dont run running will only reenable the fear you have of the situations try to be calm as you can possibly can if your feared situations involves other people youll probably get one of two reactions hey are you okay man you seem a little pale faced do you want me to get something for you to eat or drink or okay this guy is acting a bit weird but whatever its his business inner monologue in the persons head this notion that everyone will hate us or have ill thoughts about us is not rational and is again over exaggeration when your fight or flight is activated you probably will not be able to start questioning these thoughts because of all the fear and panic you have and the fact that you are maybe in a public place and cannot just talk to yourself like a crazy person but when your brain calms down try to question the thoughts so that youll become more independent of them that way the next time you find yourself in the tight spot your brain will be more prepared until you eventually overcome the feared situation fully and own it like a boss make positive confessions to yourself by yourself for us whove experienced anxiety just the thought of making positive confessions makes us cringe but bare with me here im not talking about situations where you say im skinny but in reality youre fat you get the point here im talking about embracing all of those good qualities you have within yourself and embrace them all of us have those things there were many situations in your life where you didnt just do a nice thing but a great thing maybe youve helped a buddy out with some money or advise maybe you saved someones life maybe you have good social skills despite being socially anxious whatever it is embrace it repeat it let it become a mantra or a prayer to you whatever we believe about ourselves determines how we will act in different situations if you have the belief that you are a shitty person full of only bad luck that will be your life if you embrace however all of your flaws try to change them and have positive beliefs about yourself that will be your life most of these tips to some degree are rooted in cognitivebehavioral therapy cbt however read this with caution im not some prophet or even a professional and i could be terribly wrong somewhere down the road its best to do your own research or even consult a professional since youll get the best feedback there is peace",0
outside or the go outside and talk to people youll feel better,0
swimming they were just generally rude like before starting questions i let them know it will take min and there will be questions they still ended up getting annoyed with me for how it took i guess a lot of it is because i am naturally not assertive some thought it was not enough to not participate they had to insult me idk why their faces keep on swimming in my head with their comments,0
runs maybe you did not confront it when you were younger sad also runs intensely through my parents i wonder every damn day why did they had children one of the most irresponsible desiciones of their life i started experiencing crpiling anxiety right at the transicion of highschool ever since it has been there but there are times of varying intensity for example in the baccualerate i remember that the classes were very sociable and everyone would be fooling around all the time this got terribly on my nerve and i was almost unable to leave my house or even talk on the phone if your parents also have sad its very unlikely that you did not show its symptoms earlier on,0
outside well done on opening up like this i can safely say i was nowhere near brave enough to do what you have done when i was your age you should be proud of yourself already i was pretty much the same as you at and still have those problems at but i am begining to change for the better one thing you can do is to think of conquering sa like training a muscle meeting strangers and talking to girls are outside of your comfort zone but everytime you venture outside it and allow yourself to sit with the feelings and thoughts your comfort zone grows and your distress zone shrinks think of it like a bicep if your bicep starts small and weak and has a lot of excess fat around it over time through many bicep curls and training it to its limits and beyond it begins to grow and become stronger and the excess around it goes away as well now its not healthy to have everything be within your comfort zone our bodies need some fat distress is sometimes a good thing but not when it interferes with our lives in a negative way so be aware of how you feel in stressful situations and gradually train yourself to cope with them and grow your comfort zone by mindfully pushing yourself out of it gradually start by saying hi and go from there i spent all of highschool and yrs and avoiding girls i liked or that liked me as well as not opening up to friends to build deeper connections not because i wanted to avoid them but just because it seemed to happen by itself it caused me great despair and i would never wish it upon anyone else i wish you well and remember to forgive yourself for mistakes its fine to make them,0
run i say go with your gut feeling if you have any reason at all to take the promotion i would take it you might feel uncomfortable with it at first but it the long run you might be much happier,0
running getting a haircut also causes a lot of anxiety for me and i usually keep delaying it for months until i cant avoid it anymore but my fear isnt into running someone almost no one knows me anyway but that the hairdresser will be outgoing and talkative that always causes so much awkwardness and discomfort since i simply cant communicate with people properly so i just hope that i get someone who isnt that talkative,0
running i want to so badly but i cant i cant even talk to her about normal stuff let alone something as big as this being in love sucks shes always a background process running in my brain eating up all my ram if that makes sense also shes incredibly smart im completely incompetent shes verrrry pretty im hideous she is quiet but still incredibly popular i have zero friends you get the point i dont deserve someone as good as her and she doesnt deserve someone as horrible as me although shes told me a couple of times that she thinks im a kind person i bet her neutralslightly positive perception of me would instantly go down the drain,0
running gps are the worst so im and have suffered quietly from sa for several years a few days ago i thought id take the bold step and arrange an appointment with my local gp to see if he could help with anything give advice or whatever however with a room full of people waiting to see him he was running about minutes behind i quickly realised that i had to sit in the middle of the room with everyone staring my worst nightmare i could feel everyone staring he finally called my name and within ish minutes i was out of the surgery why he panned me off his words were i think your just doing it for the attention attention i sat there thinking you really have no idea do you i came to see for help as i hate drawing attention to myself etc i answered all of the questions he had for me and in the online questionnaire same questions it said i needed to see a doctor re sa back to my bedroom for the year for me,0
run useless at relationships i dont think i would even call them relationships theyre more like nonrelationships because nothing has ever happened before im and i have never been on a date a few months ago i was on a dating app and matched with a few girls but never really had the guts to continue chatting much i deleted the app a few days after i downloaded it because i got so much anxiety just looking at the app i downloaded the app again minutes ago and saw that one of the girls had actually given me her number and invited me to chat with her on whatsapp shit i then proceeded to delete the app again even though that message was sent about months ago i realised that whenever someone irl gives me a little attention ill freak out internally and act disinterested in whatever theyre saying afterwards help what can i do to have more game and not run off whenever someone shows even the teeniest bit of interest in me,0
run yeah it can technically be more debilitating in the long run lol but this post was meant to be more comical than serious,0
sun there isnt one and the window is right in front of the sink also i dont live alone i cant mess up the curtains everytime i go to the kitchen or other areas where i feel exposed besides i need the sun light and i want to convince myself that i can live normally without acting like a freak,0
run as a woman this isnt being vain this is a protection mechanism if anything its normal for people without sa to act awkwardly around people theyre attracted to and as a female when a stranger appears to be attracted to you you tend to go on the defensive sometimes sometimes as in the case of people with sa its just someone who is awkward around everyone but sometimes it is because theyre trying to hit on you which can make some women put their guard up sadly in some situations its safer to do that than to be nice and run the risk of them getting the wrong idea you underestimate how many creeps there are out there sadly,0
running i hate how i cant do things on my own i really want to see a show at a local theater but i have no one to go with tickets are cheap and its a short drive im really thinking about going but i know if i go by myself people will probably be like why are they alone and i look a lot younger than i really am so that doesnt help sometimes people think im lol this sucks because this show is really good and i wanted to take advantage of the cheap tickets and short drive while its still running people are actually flying from different states and driving long hours just to see this show and ughh it just sucks i have no one to go with and since its close by i might see people i know and that would suck if im alone like whyyy cant i just go by myself my friends that like theater are away for college and im not going to force anyone who doesnt like theater to go with me its just killing me how close it is and my anxiety is stopping me from going alone,0
run hes spotting the indians run and hide,0
horse thanks for the recommendations ill give those a try i wish it were easier for me to change those shitty beliefs though for a while i actually was getting better and having an easier time shutting out that mental horseshit being nicer to myself and trying the whole shamelesslyyou thing idk what in particular triggered the regression but im right back down to where i started and it really sucks to have all that hard work and progress go down the drain with one bad social experience i kinda feel like im not mentally strong enough to keep that positivity up tbh i tried so hard last night to tell myself over and over again its okay they probably didnt think it was weird anyway they probably already forgot if they did youre fine its okay dont worry about it just relax breathe but it wasnt enough the anxiety and self loathing overtook me and its extremely hard for me to pull myself out of it lately,0
boat i am deffo more in the boat of i like it cause i can hide my face im self conscious about my facial expressions and what my mouth is doing i dont care so much about what ppl think of what i wear thats super interesting tho,0
outside i feel the same sometimes no one in my big family had social anxiety except for me my mother had mild social anxiety in her twenties but my siblings dont have it my childhood was weird tho i was problematic as fuck they were beating me but it never helped for them i had the worst attendance in my school ever cash me outside how bout dah,0
garden this sucks so much the only way ive found to get over it is to turn my anxiety into antisocial behaviour okay im ready to leave my apartment for work what if the neighbour is watering her garden and asks what my plans are for the holiday weekend just put in your earphones keep your head down and completely ignore her,0
outside late teens early twenties are a road of suck for most people strange imbalances between your level of experience social and financial leverage personal freedoms and new responsabilities i think youll benefit from realising real life isnt like the movies there might be the occasional highlight to some periods in peoples lives but around every shining peak of ammagah livin the life theres weeks and months of routine slog stupid setbacks insecurities unexpected surprises and absolutely banal events that can be easily mistaken for bad omens or lifelong scars most things dont matter as much as they feel like few people get to their thirties without realising that people make plans life doesnt care and that the only way to know what the future will bring is to somehow end up right in the middle of it im now and if theres one thing id tell my year old self to worry less assume less just give things a try without trying to guess too hard what the result will be youll be fine in the end if you can avoid the worst fuckups and not having many or any friends or having low grades or not knowing what you want arent worst fuckups therell be a lot youll have pretty much no control over what other people think want do is all not up to you it takes two people to have a bond two people who each think hey this other person is pretty cool the only thing you do have for the most part control over is your own thoughts your own judgements and values your own choices those will define how a situation impacts you and whether a setback will turn your life into a living hell or whether itll be something you take in stride and get past with minimal heartache observation the only reason high school friends are such a thing is because people who spend a lot of time cooped up together tend to develop a social relationship good or bad because its impossible not to kind of get to know someone if you see them for several hours every week day familiarity and forced interaction means its easy to get comfy with people and have pleasant interactions at a fairly low active effort cost in college and adult life youve got more flexibility to where you spend your time and who with with the downside that life will no longer offer you easyfriendmaking environments on a silver platter it takes effort to get out the door man i dont put on my outside pants for just any random joe shmoe p and once youve got the freedom to plan your own activities during the day youll realise that you have an activation energy a sort of cost to deciding to socialize too if what you get out of it isnt worth the effort welp you lose touch with each other how many friends you have in the end also doesnt matter for shit i always thought id rather be lonely than beg for attention of people who dont care about me and that i also dont care about end result after enduring a long stretch of finding nobody interesting by now ive got a few close friends i trust and thats perfectly fine by me invest actively in people who have things in common with you that you actually enjoy spending time with lifes too short to waste it chasing poor quality bonds if you have good ones then put in some work to keep the contact alive dont be surprised if it turns out that outside of a school context you honestly dont have that much to share with each other though that happens often and youd hardly be the first to start way overthinking what this implies it implies nothing it just means that that particular friendship was fueled and facilitated more by circumstance than by an active desire to invest in the friendship hanging out with friends can be fun if you have good ones but if theres nobody around who also feels man id love to hang out with this person then welp cant do more than be yourself anyway and try to grow as a person on the way its up to other people to decide if they like what they see and their opinions have nothing to do with your worth as a person the ability to be confident in your own worth your own choices your own values even in absence of other people actively supporting that is a very big one to cultivate try to focus on what you can do with your own power each day to make your life feel workable and worth living to you the rest is frills and good things will come by taking care of yourself and your mental health well is the best way to make sure youll have the alertness and the courage to take advantage of those opportunities no matter if they come often or only once in a blue moon,0
outside accepting my negative thoughts made me okay with my social anxiety i dont know where to start but i was looking for a subreddit where i can let loose of my experience with anxiety and i found this placeso yeah ive always felt as if i had social anxiety ever since middle school i believe it was due to the fact that all i could ever think about was world of warcraft and literally nothing else mattered to me besides online video games that followed into my freshmen year but then i started cross country then during my sophomore year i started to grow into myself and reach pubertygetting a wonderful girlfriend at the age of for years we were dating on and offbreaking up twice and i feel as if in those years i really started to feel like ive discovered who i truly was but then in i started paramedic school and was told by a classmate that if i start taking adderall that i will study for hours without taking a break and never feel tired that got me really excited especially trying it later that week and instantly got hooked a year goes by and my addiction for adderall took back all of that progress that i had on discovering myself i felt as if i was a robot whenever i was coming down or wasnt on adderalli didnt have any emotions i felt sad but couldnt cry i never felt happy there would be moment where i was know something is really funny but i couldnt laugh this with other factors ruined my relationship with my year long girlfriend after this i stopped taking adderall for about months i had major anxietyespecially social anxiety but when i got a job as a paramedic that all goes away because of the situations youre put in days a week for hours straight after working as a paramedic for about months i had my worse call ive ever had we were the first ones on scene for a month old who is in cardiac arrest we worked the child for minutesit really got to me for about months after that i would start crying randomly thinking about the child as well as being upset about this i gained my anxiety back i would come to a point where i would wake up in my apartment deathly afraid to even go outside to go talk to my twin brother even making eye contact made me so scared after awhile it got a little betterbut at the time i always had that anxiety in the back of my mind constantly thinking about stupid stuff with social interactions but then one week i had a week off of work and i decided to take acid with my close friends yes i know taking drugs especially when youre a healthcare provider is frown upon but who cares i felt great for hour but then i suddenly couldnt stop thinking about how i could think of something to say to my friends but would be too scared if it wasnt that greator making eye contactam i staring at them for too long am i creepy what the fuck is wrong with me i went into a negative spiral my friends tried to help but there was no distracting me ive had this happen before when i am sober but nothing like this suddenly after minutes of completely fighting my negative thoughts telling myself that having this thoughts was not normal and i need to stop immediately i just accepted it fully i told myself that its okay to be having these thoughts when i accepted it i didnt have that major anxiety before my anxiety was causing this like heavy blanket placed onto me and i felt as if i was being smoldered or being drowned i literally just said it is okay to be in my thoughts and to be alone and to stop thinking about what the others might be thinking it might of been the acid which is making it feel very memorable but damn i felt as if i had this huge weight come off of me it has been weeks since this trip but i feel as my anxiety is getting better im sorry if this is a long post and i dont care if anyone else reads this th grade essay writing skills wall of text from a year old but i had to write this somewhere im loving life now because i feel as if my experiences with anxiety has made me more of a empathetic person and a greater paramedic i never thought anxiety was a real thing until you have it so bad that you cant even make eye contact with your own twin brother i will always know that i will have some social anxiety but with my experiences of overcoming these inner demons of mine i know ill survive much much more tldr social anxiety once was fucking my life up but with time i know it gets better you just have to trust the process,0
"walk, outside heck my anxiety doesnt allow me to leave my home unless i look my best how painfully i relate to this most days i long for the quiet confidence some women seem to have where they can walk outside and be completely comfortable with how they look even if its a little bit messy im a very simple person but the idea of leaving the house looking even remotely unmade due to the fear and anxiety that comes with being in public makes leaving home more of a battle than it should be that aside i wish i had the answer you were looking for making friends as we get older becomes horrendously difficult even when you dont have social anxiety the opportunity for open and friendly conversation doesnt provide itself often with the right people but the idea i suppose is knowing how to spot when youve found the type of people to persue friendship with because its not just about you putting in the effort but those people reciprocating i wish you all the best",0
run all of those grunge meisters are just like you with different clothes on and different chemicals in their system people think being in another clique is some different world with different customs and trends but their all the same the cool attractive guys and girls run the show whether their innocent or grunge or academics or artists people who are less cool and less attractive scheme to become more important in their social group and then theres the guy you pass in a liquor store with no friends an empty weekend and a few extra dollars thats me haha the only difference between you and a guy that drinks is that youre not drinkin we all were squares once then we drank and poof the mysterious allure was gone someday youll buy some beer maybe and experience how unimportant it is,0

walk its a pretty human thing to not do the most optimal thing all the time it can be frustrating as an onlooker to see people not make the most of what they could be but thats the part where it helps to realise its other peoples life to live its their freedom to make ignorant or lazy decisions ive been attempting to just lead by example when people think theres no point i just tell them they might wanna consider they might be wrong and theyre always free to decide to change things up its easy for people to get so used to a situation that they assume thats just how things are seriously man rationality and humanity are just really not all that compatible and thats not anyones fault try to think of it as people with a lot to gain rather than as people who threw away something mind i do get that some days its hard to see people slack and go holy shit i didnt get to get away with that why would you it can feel really unfair that others shouldnt feel the pressure that you did that they should be somehow exempted from the efforts you put in on my worst days i sometimes got actively derisive and aggressive with people i felt werent pulling their weight or not doing anything about their problems other than whine thats the part where i had to learn to remind myself that if id gotten positive support and patience i mightve actually done better way sooner if id had someone say eh your achievements may not look like much but i believe you can do it instead of bah look at you being all indolent and weak that maybe i wouldve felt less defensive and like i needed to dig my heels in and go no back off stop expecting things from me who the fuck are you to judge me i agree that some people might need a wake up call a bop in the head like youre setting yourself up for failure a bit of awareness would be good here so you dont get caught with your pants down later i agree that some people have made it a sport out of bunkering down and joining the cool rebels club of rejecting society like some of the worst neets trying to tempt others into giving up too thats actively making the world a shittier place but i think the vast majority of us just do respond like puppies be mean to us and we become afraid and passive be friendly to us and be an example of good attitudes and positive expectations and well wag our tails and get tempted to follow sometimes sad pups just need someone to hunker down and smile and go heyyy there whos a good pup cmere wanna go out for a walk without focusing on the shyness without negative expectations without trying to fix a problem just a positive invitation and respect for their tempo seriously i got so sadangry once with my parents demonstrating they were more capable of treating the damn dog like that than me it wouldve worked wonders on me and on many people if positive reinforcement were the default approach awwww look at the dog when we do this and this and we never yell or be vindictive to him and reward good behaviour hes so eager and motivated yeah lets maybe start trying that on people too ive gotten a damn lot further in making people both improve and like me for the support compared to being drill sarge nasty which in turn makes me feel less frustrated too note to self make a post on here about positive reinforcement,0

running i also work at a grocery store im a bagger and its got to be one of the hardest things ive done its really got me out of my comfort zone in a good and bad way its made my anxiety way worse but its allowing me to actually socially interact with some people i kind of have a delusion that people are constantly making fun of me no matter what i feel as if everyone is playing a massive joke on me and everyone hates me work gets so tiring mentally and physically that i start showing how exhausted i am and people ask if im ok i also just start running through every situation in my head and look spaced out as people have said but then my worst fears get squashed as when i interact the person i think hates my guts and is purposefully avoiding me goes great and now i think they like me until i see them and get anxious again its a interesting cycle as i have no logical reason for thinking they dont like me its also strange how eye contact works as a bagger i am forced to make eye contact smiles are also a part of the uniform and sometimes after a while you just cant pull it off but eye contact thats a funny one its very tiring thinking of when or when not to make eye contact then getting anxious about what just happened i start panicking a lot just because of eye contact well i started rambling but i just wanted to share my similar situation and tell you that youre not at this alone the more you work there the better your social interactions will get and the easier it will become good luck homie,0
"climb, mountain thanks for the kind words you have identified my problem very well i think i just cant help comparing myself to others all the time and i feel like such a loser in comparison i have been preparing for the presentation in the past weeks but in the end it feels absolutely insignificant in terms of overall success in life ive climbed a pebble yet there is an insurmountable mountain still ahead of me i do wonder if it will always feel this way whether after i climb the mountain therell be an even bigger one still certainly looks like it im definitely going to discuss this with my therapist",0
run first off porn and masturbation can lead to this and is a real cause for why men feel the way they do around girls porn and masturbation actually changes your brain and the way you think and react around girls second have a positive mindset you might be extremely nervous feeling like your heart is beating out of your chest but maintain a good positive mindset youd be surprised at the difference that alone can make third when people are faced with situations like these when confronting a girl as a cashier or whatever the situation is your fight or fight response comes into effect you either run and avoid it or you stay and fight it theres also another part of this effect called reasoning reason with yourself and reason about the situation the situation and task is not above you or so daunting you cant succeed and have confidence doing it you are fully capable as anyone else you just happen to have social anxiety so it becomes a lot harder also build yourself up the only way to truly becoming better at these scenarios with less anxiety is by actually doing them try something small and go up from there if it starts with going through a checkout line with a girl cashier then try it the more you try it and experience it the more comfortable you will be and more confidence you will gain these articles helped me a lot to understand social anxiety and taught me to do some things that helped me good luck bro remember there will be times you mess up or look dumb or say the wrong thing dont be discouraged this is a journey not a overnight transformation keep going and dont be discouraged,0

"walk, running oh dancing is definitely my biggest public vulnerability ive done comfort zone challenges in the forms of public shenanigans walking is slow motion lying down beside a bus stop running through high traffic areas with my hands raised in the air nope none of that stuff translated or gave momentum to day to day interaction if you want to challenge yourself you must tackle the issues directly and dont expect other areas to necessarily bleed into them indirectly",0
swimming very similar position as yours i know how you feel because such a manifestation is very scary for others to notice it can raise some eyebrows for me its for forcing laughter and positivity just like swimming against the current your body tells you to cry but instead you make it laugh the apples of the cheeks really hurt afterwards as well correct me if i am wrong but does your spasms and cheek tension relax a lot and allow you to laugh when others laugh at what you said,0

basketball stiffness social anxiety makes me so stiff its like my muscles just cant relax because im always so tense and anxious all the time like earlier today in gym my teacher made us play a game of basketball and during the game my movements were just so weird and robotic especially when i was handed the ball and had to dribble down the court i just wish that i could just relax and look as normal and comfortable as everyone else because this shit makes me feel and look like an old man with back problems at the age of,0

"outside, cruise, walk, running social anxiety and my first crush hi all brand new to reddit but a long time lurker ive decided to try and take some action over an ongoing situation thats stretched out these past few weeks and maybe you guys might be able to help me from what i gather the people here seem decent and some of the advice ive seen dished out over the years is excellent so i might as well give it a go just to start off with ill give you some basic information on whats up im a shiny new uni student in her first year first semester and living with some pretty intense social anxiety and depression thats been ongoing since i was about my teenage years were chaotic and everything that couldve gone wrong went wrong id just moved schools had no friends because i was way too shy and depressed i watched a relative die slowly from cancer id made up my mind that i wouldnt live past starved myself the whole works i had zero self esteem and couldnt relate to anyone and at the time those years were the worst years of my life up until two years ago when my anxiety reached its peak id dropped out of uni because it had gotten to a point when i no longer gave a fuck about anything or so i thought turns out my anxiety had manifested into panic disorder and im talking agoraphobia fear of being harmed or killed by strangers panic attacks from the moment i woke up until i managed to finally put myself to sleep pure unbridled fear and i lost a shit ton of weight too because i physically couldnt bring myself to eat it was so bad i lived in constant fear of going insane and ending up in a madhouse had an intense fear of meds and was convinced id kill myself whether accidentally or not last year i somehow managed to pull myself out of the shit drug free and without any outside help aside from my best friend and my mum please dont do this get help i studied and worked the hardest ive ever worked to get back to uni because i failed so many units last time it was hard slog and having achieved what shouldve been an impossible task through the most perseverance id had in years i got back into my dream school studying what i really love and got accepted to live at a residential college thats super hard to get into because its so popular the first two months of uni i was happier than id ever been talking to people going to classes trying new things id never felt so confident but out of everything i did talking to this boy was one of the best things i ever did this was day one one hour into my uni journey i sit down at this table as it fills up and im chatting away with almost every one i couldnt believe how well i was doing this guy sits next to me and eats his dinner not saying a word an hour later every one eventually finishes and leaves and its just me and this guy just as im sitting there wondering if itd be strange to say hello so late he reaches out his hand and introduces himself to me i laugh and tell him i was just stewing over whether or not to say hi and we immediately hit it off hes kind of quiet but well spoken and everything we talk about just seems to come naturally an hour later we exchange details and im overjoyed finally a nice cruisey guy i can make buds with or so i thought flash forward seven weeks and i have a massive crush on this guy the first few weeks it was all kosher he invites me around campus to do stuff i invite him in return and even though we dont see each other very often two very different majors hes unbelievably easy to talk to and just a really nice guy then i realise i have a crush on him at first i thought it was anxiety because ive never had a crush before but man this is a crush every time i see him its like a gut punch and i feel so winded its not just the fact that hes mega cute but his personality is absolutely amazing we also share a lot of common interests so we have heaps to talk about which definitely helps in the developingacrushdepartment i really like this dude but im so lost i feel like were friends but at the same time i dont really know him at all weve talked for hours over several occasions but seven weeks isnt nearly enough time to get to know someone right so how am i already crushing on this guy so hard the thing is that its hard to say if its one sided but maybe its because of how badly i want to pursue this despite how scared shitless i am and that i really want it to work out hes not much of a texter and rarely gets back to me when we text but considering his major completely understandable hes not inviting me places at the moment and sometimes i wonder if hes trying to create some distance between us the thing is when we do catch up and talk its super comfortable and natural and i dont feel unwelcome at all the other day we spent and a half hours talking after lunch then at dinner wed both well and truly finished before i approached him by the way another and a half and even then as we walked out of the dining hall he encouraged me to continue the overarching issue is that while my first few weeks here were spent on an immeasurable high the past weeks ive seen some pretty low lows ive become super self conscious and next to had a nervous break down as a result i isolated myself from my friends and stopped saying hi to people and he was one of them because i didnt want to burden him it has nothing to do with other people but often when i feel like this i have this idea in my head that i annoy people and i worry constantly about annoying him even though i find it hard to imagine him getting annoyed at anyone even though i know for a fact this guy is single i feel like im not good enough and annoying and being too pushy im dropping so many hints so surely hed get them by now right but then again dropping hints is so medicore and i cant expect something to be obvious to him because its obvious to me but then again maybe hes just not interested and too polite to say so i have no idea the thing is that i think hes like me especially with things hes said before hes the quiet type and sometimes i wonder if he worries about the same things i do too but he also rarely ever says hi to me even when he passes me directly on the way to class and i know for a fact he sees me but maybe ive brought this on myself during those two weeks where i retreated back into my shell he takes up so much space in my head and i wonder sometimes if this is just anxiety running its course i doubt i take up any space in his but i am a chronic overthinker and this has bothered me for weeks he told me hes only staying here a year before moving out and now i feel like i need to say something at least once or lll regret it but i dont have a lot of self confidence and i honestly believe hes way out of my league is it really fair that i expect him to date someone with a history like mine especially with all my personal problems i dont want to pass that onto him it sucks ass and i like him too much to want to ever do that as it stands i believe i have a few options stop giving a fuck and obsessing over this aka live in the moment and focus on building our friendship before anything else i like this one and am already pursuing this one but yet again am i being too pushy let it go even knowing hes single and regret it for the next few years or possibly forever he also has tindr so should i swipe right we live so close together though and if this goes pear shaped i dont want it to be awkward between us this is long as shit but i need some serious help ive talked to my mum and friends about this but sometimes an outside perspective can really help with these kinds of things youd seriously make my year its my first time posting so i just wanna finish by saying that i hope you guys are doing well in your endeavours if you needed to hear it today im proud of each and every one of you looking forward to hearing your replies soon tdlr i have a crush help",0
run anxiety of being alone in public ive always been an over thinker but my sa didnt really get bad until the start of middle school the biggest thing that triggers my anxiety is being alone in public its almost impossible for me to go to the mall or shopping anywhere because i constantly feel like everyone is watching me and judging me also the fact i could bump in to anyone from school at anytime is horrifying i can barely go an hour in the mall without having to take a break and sit down to let my mind calm down when im with my friends the anxiety i feel is bearable compared to being alone also any sort of confrontation no matter how minor gives me a panic attack an example being someone telling me not to run in the halls ill be overthinking what they said for the next half hour calling myself stupid for doing what i did even if it really doesnt matter sometimes i just want to be invisible not to be seen by anyone this is pretty hard for me though because im a pretty big dude for my age years old my anxiety stems from an excessive sweating disorder i have many people have made fun of me for it after my sa got bad ive been called socially inept im starting high school in one week just thinking about doing presentations or giving speeches is already giving me anxiety my friends dont really like going out the only place i really see them is at school or on discord what can i do about my sa that doesnt involve therapy im tired of not having the self confidence to do what i want,0

outside obsessivesocial anxietyis anyone out there ok so basically im a year old female in college and ive never come close to dating anyone let alone barely even talk to the male gender unless if im black out drunk and what ive found what has happened to me about four times ever since high school is that if i get a crush on someone all of four ive never even known them personally or ever talked to them except for the last one but who i met once and talked with him normally but i was seriously intoxicated and these crushes are essentially obsessions since i dont even know them at all really and will just stalk on social media obsessively and then have all of these hypotheticals and what not in my head like im talking to them and sometimes dreams and its just the creepiest thing ever and i always try to get myself to stop but i can never find a way literally the only way i will completely stop is if i meetcome into contact with the next guy to obsess over and then after i meet the next guy i legit dont even think about the past guy for another second ever again and its just so stupid i cant but it gets even worse because the last guy who i met one year ago at an outside day party in college when i was superrrr drunk and it was fine at first that day bc i was basically blacked but then he started snapping me a few days later and asked me to hang out and i literally couldnt respond even though i straight up think i sorta liked him honestly i did but i always tell myself that i didnt to justify myself and definitely after bc when i stopped talking to him i kept obsessing with him the entire year and beat myself up over it and i regretted it so much but it gets even worse we met in at the beginning of the fall semester and maybe snapchatted for a few weeks and then i saw him like once in person at a party a month later and didnt say anything but over the course of that semester i cried drunk and sober about it like times because i dont know why im holding myself back but i just couldnt talk to him without being super stressed and anxious and uncomfortable that i dont want to at all and ok then its the end of the winter semester so literally april and im still obsessed but probably not as much but still i havent met anyone else new the entire year who ive become obsessed with over him so my friend convinced me to make a tinder and i just got it as a joke and i saw him come up on my tinder after a while and whenever he would come up i would close out of it because i just couldnt i was so stressed ok and then eventually after like a few weeks i went out with my friends drinking and my one friend swiped on him along with a lot of other people and of course it was a match and then he messaged me it takes me like multiple days to respond to him and then he responds in like hours to whatever but the convo makes me cringe to look at it and it just hurts but then im legit been obsessed with this guy forever it just makes sense and then i said when i remembered meeting me and he didnt exactly remember the time i met him but obviously knew who i was still and then im the one who didnt respond to him after that when he asked what i was doing this summer because i just cant ive sorta forgot about him this summer but not really especially when i am doing nothing productive and just laying around and have nothing better to think about and it got especially bad tonight that id figure id write it out on here so yeah ive told my friends the outline of this but definitely not the details of how im super obsessive and creepy because i just think its so embarrassing and hate myself im just wondering if anyone else is like this at all in terms of social anxiety or obsessiveness or any advice or support that im not insane would be greatly appreciated,0

running this subreddit is made for people like you who want to relate their sa problems so dont worry about bothering anyone thats why people like me are here d i had a similar situation with a girl i met on class she seemed so interested in me and i didnt even knew why finally we hanged out and she asked me for a kiss i didnt know how to react i started to shake and i was so anxious at that time that i just ran away well not literally running i said i had to go and think about it and went home for good that stressed the fuck out of me and i stayed at home for days because i didnt want to see her finally i realised i did the most stupid thing i couldve done so i tried to talk to her to meet i really liked that girl when we saw each other i said i liked her too and we kissed when i remember this the only thing i can think about is that i regret not taking advantage of that chance when i could and just kiss her that couldve been so much easier but thats how sa works i guess and about the sex question if you have the chance just take it or you will regret not having done it good luck man i hope it works out,0
running three group projects in one day lol sorry for the long post i really need to vent today was fucking brutal worst day in recent memory by far not even the only thing that happened today but it had the biggest effect yesterday was awful too first day of class this group that i thought was starting to accept me last semester pretty much just outright ignored me they barely even said hi and didnt leave me a seat with them so okay i sit dead back in the last row alone a long day too hours of class but no it wasnt enough that im the only person in a class of people thats completely alone and that hasnt been able to befriend a single person in years years if you count the other college i dropped out from it really had to be rubbed in my face first class was bad enough make your own groups bullshit etc etc my heartbeat spiked like i was running a marathon and i felt like my head was gonna explode it was so fucking humiliating to be the only person without a grouppartner not only that but even the fucking professor forgot about me so i thought ok whatever fuck off im just not gonna do it its of the grade which is a lot but whatever but the girl that was writing the groups for him saw me who happened to be one of the people in the group that i thought was accepting me lmao and she said something and the room went silent and awkward until someone took pity and said i can work with them okay finally over i attempt to relax a bit but minutes later the next class starts same professor and he announces the same fucking shit another group project for that class but the groups cant be the same because theres less projects in this one or something so again i go through the same process i stress myself out etc then at the same time that girl from the group that i was trying to fit in with and another one from another group thats in weirdbad relations with that first one tell me i can work with them out of pity literally at the same time so of course i have to fucking pick between the two and whoever i pick the other one will be offended so i just say well ill see by the end but then when the turn came for the group which accepted to work with me the first time also named me to be in this group too okay fine finally over right hours later different class different professor same fucking shit but this time no one even offered the two girls that i was afraid one of them will get offended if i pick the other one turns out both of them were probably offended because i picked the third group not that i had much say in the matter so no one offered anything by the end including that group which accepted me for the other two projects because these groups had to be smaller so ok here we go again i go through the same stress etc until at the end i get put into a random group where ill be expected to do all the work but yeah beggars cant be choosers also because i always waited until the end i have projects do to at the worst possible date around the finals so thats gonna be fucking great im honestly considering dropping out and the day only got worse from then on fuck this,0
outside after building up my self esteem for months i received an unprovoked comment today which is making me feel like staying inside for days growing up i was bullied pretty vehemently my looks were made fun of it was at its worst between ages where it got to the extent of consistent facebook messages and dedicated group chats just to bully me this just told me that i was too ugly to go outside and socialise so i never did that was a good years ago now ive tried to work on myself i got a haircut i grew some facial hair i dressed properly and it seemed like my face developed a bit more i still didnt get any attention compliments or interest from girls though well until last year where i hooked up with this beautiful girl off tinder she was actually my first everything in an intimate sense which is bad to admit considering i did it with a random tinder girl but you know it was a massive selfesteem boost for the time being in the months since then ive carried myself better and felt more of an inbuilt self confidence id even say that i was edging towards socialising going out and maybe even going out drinking and stuff experiencing things i never did growing up because now i felt decent enough to do so well i did feel decent anyway anyway today i passed a random schoolgirl who was with what i assume to be her boyfriend for some reason i felt intimidating without even making eye contact with them so i got out my phone i looked down and i was texting on my phone minding my business then after i passed them she turned around and said youve got a big nose dear god i felt like i was in high school again and im now i know my nose was and still is big but i was hoping that i wouldve grown into it with age ive only really had one or two comments on it in about four years so i thought i was finally past that point of it being an issue but evidently not after all i received a comment completely unprovoked from a total stranger a total stranger looked at me for all of seconds and immediately found a flaw with me and it has made me feel completely awful moments like this just make me feel completely undesirable and add further damage to my alreadylow self esteem i know i shouldnt give such power to a yearold schoolkid whos just trying to get a laugh out of friend but still it hurts because its so strongly linked to my past i was somebody who was feeling confident about going out and trying to socialise just a few days ago and now i just never want to go out again,0

"swimming, pool, pond i enjoyed life more as a child hey so something thats been bothering me lately is the reality that i can only get excited about a few things in life and i find enjoyment only in those few things back when i was a kid the smallest things made me soo happy as an example there is an indoor swimming pool i loved as a kid that has so many things to do now when i go back the magic and general excitement has vanished same goes for almost everything that made me happy as a kid all im left with is a mind to ponder the past and feel nostalgic about it which only leads to feeling sad and empty because of the present i wouldnt even say i have depression because i have hobbies and interests that i really enjoy and make me happy but its just tough to cope with how little i get out of life compared to when i was years old im now",0
outside i feel as though social anxiety has ruined the final years of my childhood i just dont want to be so lonely anymore i f have just finished year via distance ed i was doing distance ed since i was but always wanted to go back to day school because i once had friends there or saw it as an opportunity to make new friends unfortunately my social anxiety caused me to keep putting off going back to school despite this being something i really desperately wanted over the last few years especially now that ive finished i am really depressed and filled with regret for never going back my little sister despite her social anxiety decided to really push herself outside her comfort zone and return to school herself she did distance ed from age to shes got several friends now and i always feel like its something i couldve had if i really pushed myself to do i have just started my first job but im afraid that i wont be able to make friends there because im really awkward and frankly uninteresting to say the least i long for some sense of normality because the last several years of my life have been absolutely painful and horrible i really dont see how i could make any friends though i would really appreciate any advice from people who are in or have been in a similar situation that would really help me get through this really tough period because im losing hope that it will really truly get better,0
outside need a little advice regarding drinking in social situations hi so i am a year old guy i wont say that i am completely anxious or freaked out by social situations but i do avoid them if i can mainly because much of my peer groupfriends ask me to join them for clubbing and partying and in all honesty i have no clue what to do there a little background on lifestyle i am into videogames tv shows books playing music etc you get the idea i have a girlfriend of years whos equally into all this we both struggle with the socializing outside part anyhow coming back to the topic so i have no experience with alcohol smoking or any sort of drugs my friends have encouraged me to drink starting with a cup of beer and i kid you not i hate the taste of it i feel like puking even after having a few sips of alcohol in a situation like this what should i ask for instead what are some of the drinksjuices accepted in such social situations which might help me mingle along,0

outside thinking of suicide everyday everyday i think of suicide im too shy im and i dont even know how to go to hospital and what should i do there or bank or concert i feel like ive spent my whole life in a cage i look at people of the same age theyve got plenty of friends they got cars and going to a roadtrip with their girlfriends and i dont even know how to drive if i knew how to drive i wouldnt drive in that crowd anyways they go outside do shit everyday the worst part is i dont want to do something anymore i dont want friends i dont want girlfriend i dont want to go to school or any other place i just want to die i feel like the world is not for a person like me im dying inside everyday its too fucking hard man i cant stand anymore,0
run go trust me as someone who had to run a double funeral last year for my dad and grandma who died within six weeks of each other you dont notice what anyone else does but you notice if they show up or not funerals are pretty easy you show up maybe say my condolences to your colleague and then sit down for the ceremony then afterwards you can generally bail lol,0
outside yea agree as part of my office job you had to deal with outside vendors i would spend most of my time looking for emails to contact someone at the vendor site the office was essentially silent and at least people around you would overhear you speaking so i avoided it at all costs the consolation was a lot of the people i asked said it was also annoying and they hated calling people too so i wasnt alone in that feeling,0
"nature, outside i mean im kind of ok with it and im just not social by nature anyway regardless of anxiety but i think mentally im getting worse because im losing my tolerance for the outside world like i had a level of going out and maybe sometimes it was too much but i was constantly exposed to people and used to it now even the idea of small social things freaks me out so i hate that part",0
run online dating im a year old female and i have never dated anyone before i havent even had my first kiss because of how bad my social anxiety is i really want to start dating but i feel like at this point in my life online dating is the only way i will be able to meet anyone because i rarely leave my house unless im going to work target or makeup stores is online dating worth it or do most people just want to hook up will guys run when they hear that ive never dated or kissed anyone where can you meet someone organically,0
running for me it was the presentationproject in front of the class i have never been able to handle those without a panic attack and running from class in the middle of the presentation in school i got bullied a lot but in high school lucky for me people were chill but i just couldnt handle the thought of everybody is looking at me right now i am shaking i must look so stupid i cant do this even though everybody was pretty supportive and asking me if i need help im ok i just couldnt get comfortable enough to do it,0

"walk, mountain, running perfectionism is a pest i remember feeling vaguely proud of myself for all of thirty seconds after walking out of the theoretical drivers exam with a perfect score after id procrastinated on taking it for years past due out of fear of driving and fear of failure i called my parents to inform them i passed then on the way home i instantly felt depressed and worthless again because on top of having procrastinated and being one of those losers that did everything too late i wasnt even capable of getting motivation and encouragement from this hurdle id overcome it felt like that was easy what kind of stupid person would even make a fuss and think this is worth applause its toxic it really is and its good to be frustrated and want to change this giving yourself fair credit and recognition for your efforts to accept that you just did a difficult thing mentally that it doesnt matter how other people do what matters is how you are improving and working on this those are all important for staying motivated and inspired in what you do nobody performs well if theyre denied the basic fuel of satisfaction and internal reward after struggling past something tough youre not a failure but you are currently in a state where you clearly have problems giving yourself the space to breathe and feel worthy as a person as you are right now it can often feel like if i achieve this one extra milestone ill finally prove im not a total loser except that finish line never comes there will always be things you feel arent quite what you want them to be and if you stay in this mindset you could become a billionaire curing cancer and still feel like youre not good enough theres often a background of high family expectations high standards you set for yourself and erm actually being very capable but not having appropriate challenges on your own level too that can all come together to create this kind of persistent feeling that youre just not a worthy person and all your achievements are silly or pointless or embarrassing or dont really count that can take time to reverse and id recommend considering professional help like from a student counselor to discuss this with and figure out practical things you can do to tackle these thoughts and the underlying beliefs that lead to them for me it was a combination of perfectionistic highachieving parents a personality and interests that were anything but their idea of a successful person social anxiety and not being properly challenged at high school level the things i was good at were either stupid and childish or felt like i was getting good marks way too easily and the things i was bad at i got mercilessly hounded for without getting the support i needed to feel hopeful that i could ever make those work out result a pretty capable young adult who felt all she was good for was stupid stuff that her real achievements were minor and no big deal with a mountain of important expectations i felt i would never live up to anyway take yourself seriously and take this problem seriously its not your fault that you ended up with these kinds of automatic feelings that deny you any satisfaction and motivation but you can take responsability and find ways to make your life a whole lot less bleak if you tackle this at the root its very much worth it you gave your presentation you proved you have good skills even with the anxiety thats a puzzle piece to claim for your full picture tackle things one step at a time rome wasnt built in one day and social bonds and professional stability just take fucking time even if you feel youre running against the clock youre not it doesnt matter whatll happen a year from now what you might try focusing on more is whats happening now today tomorrow your plans for this week to just keep putting one foot in front of the other not like you can predict with any accuracy whatll happen in the future all you can do is look after yourself and be confident that youll sort things out as you go youll get there and in the meantime life is just going to happen as it happens theres no point denying yourself a life and holding your breath until that imaginary moment where youll feel like a real adult youre one right now a growing young adult like millions of others that are just doing their best trying to deal with the pressure and at the end of the day growing exactly a fast as works for them your path is yours impatience just makes things feel slow and stuck and pressured have a bit of faith that things will work out its allowed to be a journey that isnt always graceful or impressive give yourself the space to actually live life and see whats around the corner when you get there it might just surprise you looking back a few years from now",0
outside its fear that causes people to tailor there appearance im still in recovery from sa but i am guilty of this as well i say this a lot like alot alot but the first thing you need to realize is that social anxiety is an irrational fear people judge appearance so for someone whos afraid of judgement this is a total nightmare but its not the people or your appearance that cause the problem its your thoughts about it the next time you are in front of a mirror and you feel those emotions pay attention to your thoughts and by thoughts i mean your inner monologue say them out loud it use to go like this for me i look stupid everyone thinks i look stupid people will hate me if i look stupid everyone hates me i hate me dr thomas a richards calls these thoughts ants or automatic negative thoughts they snowball and feed off each other if you can catch them or even the first one in the chain say it out load and then tell your brain you dont like these thoughts theyre not rational and they dont help eventually your brain will no longer produce them and you will have the confidence inside of you so you wont have to worry about the outside so much i hope this helps feel free to chat with me and check out the good doctors website he is the most informed person i know of with regards to sa,0
outside my rant i have been depressed since i was years old currently but it has varied on how intense my depression was right now i have low self esteem and social anxiety but im not hardcore depressed like i used to be i can joke around talk to girls and speak in front of the class but its random one day ill be the mos outgoing guy ever but the next week ill be the quiet weird kid in the back when these thoughts are crowding my head i always look up the same questions and discussions about depressionsocial anxiety its like im looking for the right answer to help me but none of them work i hate motivational speeches and tips from people online its always the same get fit talk to yourself go outside record your thoughts etc dumb stuff like that that way of thinking is too simple depression can not be cured with those generic tips used by every normal person im also too selfaware i hate alot of people including myself toxic thoughts intrude the back of my head even though i ignore them because i know im decent human being i am lowkey racist to everyone including my ownblacks i identify with cowards villains socially awkward nerds and bad people in general i act like im the most progressive sjw guy in public but its really an act to protect my image i just want to come out and release all my toxic thoughts and tell all the people i hate to fuck off and die i feel bad for killers rapist terrorist and idiots because i sympathize with their struggles i could never admit that to people even on the internet without being crucified by everyone i like to research these terrible humanssee im acting like a good guy right now and understand how they turned out this way normalnormies lol humans dont think like this normal people hate their guts and want them to suffer for eternity i do believe they should be punished but i also wish for them to get helped and reassimilated into society see these types of thoughts hunt my mind sometimes i feel enlightened or too self aware for my own good but really im just an average guy with above average grades im not the brightestyou can tell by my grammar but i like to think im intelligent i know im better than most people in my grade i hate losing to people i know im better than league of legends is my biggest example i have been silver for three years never truly improving even though i know i have gotten smarter and better at the game however im still not god enough to carry myself out of low elo inb the motivational tips and quotes just dont i hate them all because they never help me ive seen some really good motivational tips from the internet school family etc theyre all useless to me i know i must be willing to improve myself in order to take in these tips but i just cant i want to improve i really do but i feel like im not strong enough to function in society my self worth is non existence because theyre are tons of very intelligent people in the world while im just your average guy with no selfesteem i envy my peers watching them get awards and scholarships for their success while im part of the dumbass club most of my friends are smart people but they can also be real ass holes to me like everybody i talk to the reason theyre assholes to me is because im a shitty guy they clearly enjoy talking to me sometimes but usually i get ignored when they find someone better to talk to ive never had close friends never had a girlfriend and never been truly cared for other than my family dont even think of telling me to make new friends and get interesting hobbies lol thats one of those shitty generic tips i hear all of the time its not easy finding a new hobby and i cant make true friends without changing myself from the core up actually i have made some new friends who i enjoy talking too but i dont like talking to them for too long cause im an introvert also i rather talk to my other friends but it hurts being clearly unwanted when theyre talking to each other while ignoring me i cant stand being around a group of people having a good time while im sitting near them it makes me realize how shitty my life is but i cant just drown in my depression i guess you could say the countless motivation ive gotten and seen others get have peer pressured me into not killing myself i am scared of letting down my family because theyve put so much trust and love into me so i refuse to go back to the old year old me that couldnt even speak to my family however i do contemplate killing myself everytime these toxic thoughts intrude my mind again i cant stand seeing happy people especially on reddit im a very cynical person and i love criticizing everything regardless of how much i like it when i see toxic people get flammed because of their stupidity i feel bad for them when i see someone with an onion outside of the hivemind get downvoted i upvote them when i see people insulting shitty humans and calling them monsters roasting them alive i want to downvote them all hell sometimes i even cry for bad people depending on their childhood i have no political stance and i dont care what happens to most people except myself my family and sometimes my raceblacks i feel like a disappointment because black people are some of the most progressive outspoken and consist of the most normies out of any race imo when blacks look at me they fear me because im a socially awkward weirdo or they might think of me as a coonmy worst fear if i speak up for other races like my family and black people in general are very seclusive we stick up for ourselves distrusting other races and insulting them the most i stick up for black power and all the progressive yatta yatta but also feel like we have a since of elitism that i dislike i want to understand every human being regardless of how terrible they are especially the bad ones i think serial killers are interesting even though theyre still evil people i think supervillains are badass i like seeing violence and destruction even though i shouldnt feel this way i like watching people die and i love fights i dont care if the bad side wins nor the good side as long as im entertained and safe im happy see these things are my true self but i can never talk to people about them without being hated yes i admire all the strong good people in the world but i just cant identify with the and it harms my soul i love good writing action fantasy drama crime suspense etc especially in anime but alot of anime have a clear cast of good guys while the villains are written to be atrocious monsters with no sense of humanity i hate that i like to know why the villain is like the way they are usually their stories are more interesting than the heroes however life doesnt work that way the majority of human beings are good people while shitty people rot in the dark corners of society no normal people want to hear our outcries because our ways of thinking are harmful to society i love to debate controversial topics and listen to intelligent peoples arguments without being dismissed as a terrible human being i really am not this shitty and i do love humanity but i just cant identify with all the happy sunshine and rainbows humanity thrives to be i like conflict but im also a coward i dont want humanity to suffer because i want to be safe however i like seeing conflict arouse in the streets i hate using the term sjw but i feel like that term really does make sense people are praised way too much and regarded as saints without realizing their flaws not everybody can turn out to be a social activist or a leader of a community some people are shunned from society because of our introversion social awkwardness and controversial thinking i like good people but i dont praise good people i enjoy watching these people progress while their flaws reveal to the public at the same time thats why i hate celebrities too many celebs are perceived having perfect lives and they are valued more than the average man if i died nobody would care except my family im just a speck in the universe not even known by the while some really stupid people such as the catch me outside girl become rich and famous but i realize im drowning too much int he darkness i need to start thinking positive and helping myself its all a coping mechanism in the end im constantly debating my inner thoughts changing my mind by everything i know im wrong in a lot of aspects but im also different i thrive to be unique but thats a wishful dream im positive tons of other people are just like me confused heartbroken introverted too selfaware jealous hateful but smart at the same time im always thinking about life im always thinking twice about what someone said hours earlier im always examine body gestures and coming up with deep thoughts about people i feel like the majority of people care about themselves and dont think twice about others they dont care about however i care about everybody i may be selfish but i truly care about peoples mental state i love the psychology of the human mind i love realizing what somebody truly meant when they gave a vague answer to a friend confused about their response in the end none of this matters my inability to change into a better human being hinders my thoughts being worthy of listening to im always against the hivemind while the majority agrees on a result that everyone should agree on i like to think outside of the box however alot of things i think of would not be liked by the masses i dont really believe in the toxic thoughts in my head i just want to converse with others i like changing the way i think and i like having my thoughts proven wrong but most people would rather shun me and talk to normal people sometimes i feel too intelligent for my own good but the sad truth is im not even that smart alot of my peers have better grades and an abundance of achievements wouldnt you think these people are more worth listening to than me intelligent people rule the world but intelligence is judged to much on a scale you cant be a dreamer with low self confidence and a lack of drive to work hard intelligent people are hard workers a students and confident in themselves im the opposite lazy decent grades and lowself esteem however i still o believe im underestimated their tons of people in this world that just dont fit into society but are truly worth listening toif you dont follow the masses than youre a nobody i dont want to be a leader nor a follower i simply want to observe humanity debate with others and enjoy life my dream is too get an ok job that pays well so i can play video games watch anime and browse the internet all day unfortunately life is not that easy adults always tell us how hard life is and i agree becoming an adult is scary years from now i will be i dont want to get all these responsibilities thrown on me hell i rather not work life off welfare and stay with my parents but thats called being worthless to society i want to do something that revolves around talking about the world i enjoy the a concept of journalism and media but im afraid that journalism may be dying the hard part is connections and work careers revolve around connections if you dont know anybody then you cant become anybody if you dont put in the time to work hard you wont be acknowledged by others society kills me i want to work but i dont want to work hard i cont want to become a loser working a fast food chain or some store for the rest of my life i just want to get a real job that allows me to enjoy my simple hobbies its unfortunate that my interested career is a very competitive one that rewards the hard working the smartest i might as well give up on it but i know im setting my self for failure im a lost cause i dont know what i want to focus on i enjoy alot of things but i dont want to work hard to achieve a certain one i know i need ot build skills with different things so i cna be successful but why do we need to work so ahrd to own an apartment pay bills watch anime and play games dont tell me im lazyi know and dont try giving motivational tips and advice i detest them i can not follow up on your advice so its better not giving it to me i just need someone to talk to if only i could escape from this world intro one of those generic anime shows however thats cowardly i cant just run away from my problems they must be fixed by me myself and i i wish i had the motivation to do that but motivation doest work for me ironically intimidation and discipline sort of works but eventually i turn against it im not easily intimated because i know most tough peoplemilitary people for example are just bluffing if they use violence than theyre no better than me i am a coward if i see injustice i look the other way i dont believe in stereotypes but alot of them are lowkey true i respect women and i act progressive secretly in my head im scared of change i hate how progressive we have to be i like diversity but it sucks when your favorite chracter has been changed into a minoritywomen when they couldve written a well developed character instead i feel like people attack our safe spaces such as chan criticizing our toxic thoughtsi dont identify with most of them wanting us to change how can we change if yall ridicule us without trying to help us yes alot of toxic people are straight up racist and dumb but their are some of that want to change we just cant if people shun us dismissing us with all the other losers at the end of the day im wrong women minorities and my people has been shunned by the white menhope i dont offended any white people for too long now were fighting back my inclusion with nerdy communities has given me some of these toxic thoughts i almost seem coonish but im just scared how far we are gonna change my hobbies with minoritieswomen everything ive just said in this little essay all are from the roots of my introversion as a little boy i wish i was never obsessed with gaminganime and my parents wouldve made me go outside lol i know i can change if i really wanted to but pls dont preach to me with motivational shit i said a million times it just doesnt work if you made it this far congratulations and thank you for reading i dont know where im going with this rant i started this essay out as a cry for help but i needed to release all my thoughts i guess i just want people to read this and if you do thx for reading through all my grammatical mistakes i just need to vent my frustrations out into the world without being attacked,0

run in those moments its easy to get trapped in your head thinking about how big a fool youll be if you mess up but if you can try to put your attention on your breath try consciously taking deeper slower breaths of air that fill your abdomen and expand your chest consciously focus on these deep breaths before and while saying your order this will help relax you and take the attention off the negative things that could happen if you make a fool of yourself in front of others this has helped me whenever i feel anxiety surge within me for something where i get put on the spot in a social situation especially times where i have to talk to someone and i have time before to think about what to say instead of letting my mind run rampant i try to stay focused on my breath to keep me centered and present to the moment cheers i hope this helps,0

"run, pool i just had to put this somewhere i know that im not supposed to feel bad that all my friends dont have social problems but its hard i dont feel bad that they are doing good its just that my progress is too slow i feel good for doing something right and then i feel bad that its not good enoughits so easy for everyone else and logically i know that its not right to think this way but i cant control it i feel like i started to get better too late and that im so much behind everyone else its hard to think that ill ever catch up im fucking years old and never had a girlfriend and only have a few friends all of my other friends have moved on and i dont see them anymore and its my fault now after i finally realized the mistakes that i made they are like strangers to me even if my anxiety was the only thing that i had to deal with in life it wouldnt be much easier i feel good about other aspects of my life i think i have a very healthy view on the world and on life im smart im a good person i even feel bad about writing these things here where nobody is ever going to see them i am too critical of myself and nothing is ever good enough i have too much and yet its nowhere near enough my anxiety is like a constant shadow following me everywhere and i cant seem to escape no matter what i do and its so hard to fight fear when the only cure is to experience more of it that first step is like those dreams when you run with all your strength but you dont move even a tiny bit or fighting a monster and your punches and kicks feel like you are in a pool of maple syrup and the only way forward is in your hands you have to make that move sitting around and waiting for it to pass is the worst thing you can do the fact that your willpower is the only way forward makes it so much harder there is no magic cure no book that you could read or movie you can watch its all just your responsibility you have to find the strength to move forward its worse than any other simple fear because its your whole life its like if you were a spider farmer with arachnophobia or a skydiver with a fear of heights it follows you everywhere its the only thing you think about its stop you from enjoying everything life has to offer whenever i feel good about anything in my life the shadow immediately appears over my thoughts you cant feel anything good without thinking about anxiety right after it undercuts joy of any kind and there are so many other problems that people have that are much worse but i cant think about their problems when this is everything to me my worst fear is dying before i can get over it i dont want it to be my whole life when i think about death its not itself that is bothering me its that i didnt do anything with my life that i never had love never had a relationship never had sex the only time i kissed anyone i was blackout drunk i dont even remember what it really feels like i missed out on so much because of this and whenever im alone and thinking straight i see how stupid and pointless this fear is but when im out there it completely takes me over i dont think straight i dont think at all the fear becomes everything its like a demon possessing my whole body mind and soul i dont do what i want what im supposed to its hard to do the right thing in the moment when your own thoughts betray you i realize what i should have said or done only when its over and beat myself up for it but its no use its not really me thats doing it its like a completely different person its a poisonous cloud that covers your mind its shackles you to the ground if i had time and the ability to chose what i would say or do i believe i would almost always chose the right thing if i had a popup bubble of conversation options like in a video game i would choose the right one most of the time even despite the fear but my mind wont let me i think in a healthy way only when im alone but there must be a way forward there always is its just hard to find it with all this darkness around but i will i have to im a man and its my responsibility to get better not just to myself but to my family and friends to the whole world i have to go into battle because death in that battle is far better then a life of cowardice and fear as the spartan wives used to say either return with your shield or on it or as the vikings believed valhalla awaits only the brave no matter how cringeworthy that sounds its the only truth the only way forward i have to say it to get better the opinion of others is not what matters the truth matters life without fear matters",0
outside i feel like ive lost real sympathy for my only friend since th grade at least since years but hes the only door to the outside world i have so i just cant let go of him,0

run your not alone in not having any real friends im also something heres social anxieties silver lining if you use your time wisely and find an outlet that involves minimal social interaction youd be amazed at the life you could have in relation to your peers who appear to have it better than you today in my mid s i run a business out of my bedroom where i mix and master rap music for a living it strictly takes place online however i constantly have to interact with new people and and even newer personalities on a regular basis it doable though because its not face to face im mentioning my job because i remember seeing a post like mine on reddit when i was in a rough spot in my life when wasnt there a rough spot and it sticks with you not saying it makes you more optimistic hopeful just saying that its something you remember,0
outside vent ii ugh im such a loser i have no friends no boyfriend ive cut people out of my life left and right im years old ive got a big ass and big hips im a small town girl i dance at night to release my trapped anxiety i feel so lonely at night i hate it terribly it is what it is the fact that i have a job is amazing because if i didnt have one id be loosing my mind at home sleeping i feel ugly tonight i feel fat and just unattractive i use to be so beautiful skinny perfect but we grow up then its just us idk why im posting this doesnt change anything i drink occasionally to relax and stay out of my head but then its right back to reality i wish my body was loose all the time but thats not reality i wish i slept at night all the way through i wish people would understand instead of judgement i wish i didnt have a huge wall up in my life but i do and it sucks i dont trust anything because of my past ive built this wall up as high as i can go with it and ive stayed behind it with confidence and sometimes i even lean against the wall ive created and listen to the outside world just to hear what im missing ive become incapable of seeing the big picture in life i see anger in the world and i feel sad for the way things are in this world and what weve become i try to stick to my own life and try to focus on one thing at a time but its hard theres so much hurt in this world and i want to mend everyone i see i pray for guidance and strength through god maybe im to stubborn to take his guidance and strength that he offers me or i just dont see it im blinded by everything and i dont take the time to listen and stop and just feel im afraid my life will never come together because of my fears things in my life move slow and i dont mean a snails pace slow probably something even slower than that i got a job finally i dont get paid good money but its enough to get gas and eat and probably pay for a oil change its not enough to move out or be independent i can tell you that now im afraid for our generation our president is a joke and the world has honestly become a big tom and jerry show ive been stuck in the same position for years and years and ive moved at a slow painful pace when my mind tells me to do it all but i cant i just cant ill overwhelm myself and crash i have to take everything with extra caution and make sure i see it through and through i hope and pray that something changes i ask god all the time to supply me with the knowledge i need to have to survive and the strength of a panther to go out into this world i have a lot going on in my head at times and i cant stop the spinning nooo this isnt just when im drinking its when im sober too it gets louder and tumbles like a dryer and i try to grasp onto it and when i do i get taken on a ride of negative thoughts and self destructive activity anyways umm thats all i can say for now ive let my frustration out for the most part,0
basketball work to change that maybe youre thinking but genetics fucked me i have xyz problem but thats bullshit thats whats great about being a human if youre youll never be a great basketball player but basketball is far from the only attractive thing you can do there are an endless number of ways you can choose to improve yourself and any one of them will be attractive to someone,0
running first of all your appearance isnt actually gonna make as big a difference as your confidence and demeanor but here are my suggestions anyway work out building even just a bit more muscle will help you look more mature this makes a huge difference shave off the peach fuzz even if there is barely any most men dont grow out their facial hair anyway dress a bit more nicely simple stuffstop wearing running shoes everywhere if you do that maybe cut down on tshirts style your hair just a bit if you wear glasses and can afford a more maturelooking pair make the change teenage boys rarely look puttogether but men do often im a yearold short thin woman who looks like a teenager and has a youngsounding voice it does cause uncomfortable situations sometimes but id rather have this problem than the opposite,0
"outside, sun im willing to start eating one meal a day every am in the morning because i am scared of interacting even with family and friends i really dont know how it got this bad but even so i am willing to sacrifice my hunger for a while until i get used to having one meal a day to even consider doing this i started researching whether it is even healthy to eat only one meal day but the sources i have looked at seem unreliable it seems to me that as long as you get most of your macros within a week over the long term you still have adequate nutritionfunction still regardless i am willing to sacrifice my health in order to avoid being forced into social situations i just cant deal with them for some reason anymore why am because its the time of day when everyone in my family is usually asleep aside from the stray nightly bathroom trip its a time when i am able to set aside hours for a big meal so i can then go upstairs and not be forced to see the faces of my family why do i avoid my own family because its just painful for me to look at them and not feel inadequate about myself i feel with my circumstances that its just impossible for me to feel confident in myself in life i know my parents enable me to be this way by being ignorant about what i do hint i dont do anything but except be in my room all day and night and i know its embarrassing that i would rather let them let me do this being a hermit than be outside its gotten to the point where i adjust my sleep schedule around not interacting with people nighttime is less stressful for me unless it was at a time when i had something due the next day or so i will always fluctuate between daytime and nighttime sleep cycles due to not being in the sun and not having proper routinely sleep cues but i am usually nocturnal which makes it more comfortable to not having invasive regretful thoughts about my past i would like to ask if there is anyone else who hashad considereddone this despite my being ashamed of what im doing tldr i got so socially anxious that i became mostly nocturnal and am in the process of adjusting to a onemealaday diet",0
"run, walk when i first started going to the gym couple months ago i was very nervous around people there and i wasnt really sure what i was doing of course i was self conscious of every move i made thats an everyday with sa i experienced failure and anxiety but i tried to stay persistant through it the basics of fitness is first deciding what are you going to go for endurance strength muscle growth if you want to go for strength the repetition range for each set of excercise is reps and about sets for each excercise so a good knee excersices would be leg extensions barbell lunges dumbell step ups and squats as for the heart im sorry i cant give you a good advice on how to get a good cardio workout because i dont do it myself and have little knowledge of it but in general before your workout run on treadmill for mins and after the workout do a mins walk on a moderate pace more information for knee excercises information for strength excercises cardio information what i was doing the first weeks also may not be for you but me personally i watched these guysa lot and learned so much from them not to mention they are funny and had sa issues when they were young they do fitness advice and a lot of other stuff just add hodgetwins in youtube search to your topic that you want to do research on",0

run ive been to one it cant just run as a support group where everyone there has sa like all mental illness groups it needs to be run by a therapist who facilitates conversation and encourages people to talk you cant expect that you will go and just sit there and not talk you have to be willing to be out of your comfort zone,0
run i totally understand i was really freaked out when i had to make my own appointment for the first time too and also didnt know anything you hi id like to make an appointment im a new patient them okay sure what is your name please you your first and last name them probably heard your last name wrong and asks you to repeat it you repeats last name them okay and date of birth you date of birth etc theyll ask for the name of your insurance provider a phone number they can reach you at the reason of your appointment then theyll run a couple dates and times by you to schedule the appointment thats it if they have a website sometimes theyll have the forms you have to fill out as a new patient available to print out and fill at home to save time that would be helpful in case you run in to anything that confuses you on it when it comes to questions regarding the insurance youll need info like your ssn as well andxb i hope this helped i still get anxious every time i have to go through this somewhere new its never bad like i think its going to be i promise theyre not going to judge you if you get confused at some point they deal with people all the time and would think nothing of it,0

outside entering a new group so im quite confident in the group that im in now and i dont want to leave that group entirely but theyre quite antisocial outside of school and i really want a better outside social life i used to be quite confident and outgoing but overtime have become less confident and more anxious in my ability to make friends and entertain people for some reason my mind links my self worth to how good i can make someone laugh and when i cant make people laugh straight away it makes me really doubt myself i think this stemmed from meeting my best friend who is extremely confident and seems to easily make anyone laugh and is very social i love him to death but its making me more nervous he and another friend are in the group that i want to join so there should be no reason i cant just join but i always see whenever i try that im less likes all that im less noticed because of his loud and funny personality at the same time though he gives me faith in myself when im feeling down on myself but i cant help feeling like im beta im comparison and its slowly ruining me i know this isnt a big deal or anything as im only but it feels likes my life is on the line the years right now and ahead of me are supposedly the golden years and i always feel held back from them and reflect on what im missing out socially anyway i guess what im trying to say is i really want some tips on making friends since ive lost all that i once had with new people or fairly new i really want to know how to not doubt myself and work up some courage and i want to be able to put myself out there so i can look back and see that i made good decisions and better friends that was quite long and i really appreciate if you read all that even if you have a little bit of advice that would be greatly appreciated any tips on courage overcoming fear connections humour self love and friendships is what i really need rn thankyou,0
nature you can try to build a composed nature and a little be relaxed,0
run its great that youre realising its no good in the long run and whilst i know this as well sometimes it feels that my brain just goes into automatic mode and just takes over my body so i cant do anything about it it feels even worse now since i had my first girlfriend earlier this year obviously she made all of the moves including the break up and now i miss the how it felt to be wanted so basically im on square im still going to keep on trying though even though the current path to get there looks full of hurt and misery i definitely agree about the online dating im not great at messaging and texting plus i would say that im more average looking so you probably guess what my inbox on tinderpof etc looks like haha i do have a couple of good friends who are tall more attractive and highly successful with girls even though i dont act on my jealousy it sure doesnt really help my self esteem im really surprised that you and your girlfriends never really get asked out could that say something about the way that online dating or the internet is having a negative effect on average mens self esteem thus they may not have that confidence to speak to girls they find attractive im not sure but its extremely worrying if its true actually if youre all in one group together when you go out then that can be very intimidating as theres not just a risk of being rejected by a person they find attractive but also looking like a bit of a twat in front of an audience,0
boat i dont really have a taste in music when i was younger i probably had no taste at all and it was worse but now i just listen to whatever i feel like but not bound to any genre sometimes reggae for days but sometimes metal and techno whatever floats my boat but if someone has to chose the music at a social gathering i get super unconfortable to find the right tone so i never do it just because i could play something which i might like but others wont,0
run its not hard its not hard to text someone hi how are ya especially when theyre your own friends its not hard but why am i treating this like its a freaking math problem like i need to take the steps slowly to understand and solve the problem texting someone is not a math problem its easy but am i making it so difficult for myself i hate social anxiety im overthinking everything oh i texted them minutes ago and they still havent replied guess they hate me why does no one consider texting me would reaching out be too weird and id just be annoying them do they hate me what do i talk about im too boring just forget it ill be annoying them these kinds of thoughts run threw my head whenever im about to text someone it sucks why cant i be a normal teenager and just idkbe happy about talking to friends and family i have so much self doubt and sadness in me i dont even trust the people i associate myself its just like oh youll soon leave me too so whats the point of trying i hate that mentality i havei wish i could change or completely start my life over,0
outside how am i downplaying it social anxiety is a real clinical thing and i feel it everyday outside to a point where i physically feel sick sometimes but i dont blame my problems on society or the general public i just work and figure out my own problems and recognize that no one could help myself but me its the truth,0
pool i think my problem is i dont really know what i want and plus the job pool is kinda limited since im only with no experience or anything,0
run i do this sometimes i imagine the anxiety as a wave that rolls over me and then concentrate on how im unharmed and still standing not very pleasant in that moment but it helps in the long run to accept those feelings and move on,0
swim honestly i wish i could but i feel like this is something i have to overcome on my own if i let other people excuse my behaviour because its uncomfortable for mebecause it is incredibly hard for me to put myself out there and im sure you know what im talking about then i wont ever learn to be better i think im just going to throw myself in the deep end to learn to swim ya know,0
run got into a job course wish me luck hey guys so i graduated from high school last june and besides volunteering i havent been working because of troubles trying to get a job eventually i want to attend postsecondary but still not sure for what as a result of my mild sa i have trouble with interviews and talking on the phone so i applied for a month job course its month of job skills then months in an actual job of my choice because its government run i even get paid for the first month of classroom learning anyway it starts monday so wish me luck if anyone else is having trouble getting their first job i would recommend checking to see if a similar workshop course is available near you,0
"riding, walk been there i lost it in front of of of my math professors a few semesters back crying like a baby mea yo male math always gave me massive seriously crippling another story anxiety where i work and the college i went too have a program where they will reimburse me for my classes i am also part time at the work because of the fact that im going to school if i werent technically i wouldnt be able to work there due to the contract i signed the school also accepted me because of the fact that i was working where i was basically my job was riding on school and school was riding on job we had a final test and i thought i knew the stuff decently well plot twist i didnt i have retaken multiple math classes more than once so repeating wasnt new to me but apparently my strength just want there that day so when the test is over im the last to turn in as usual i knew i did poorly due to the fact that most answers were empty i walk on up to the teacher hand her my test she asks me how i think i did i told her not great leading up to this i could feel it coming and then the inevitable tears ugly red crying face the whole shebang i spent the next five minuets just standing there crying and apologizing for having to see me in such a state i tried to stop and leave because she had another class about to come in but i just could stop i explained what was happening and she understood she said she didnt realize and that she was sorry that math and her class was this hard on me i then had to walk all way through the school with at red postcrying face that everyone knows and out to my car where i again started crying but here i now sit many math again some failed classes later and one semester away from my electrical engineering degree",0
walk yeah i get that same feeling if i miss a chance to talk to someone i feel terrible the rest of the day just try to remember that you will most likely see her again this week and just use that time to think of one thing to say then the only hard part is approaching her theres a cool trick called te three second rule when you see her just start walking towards her and dont think about whether or not youre being creepy just say something because if you wait longer your mind will flood more and more,0
outside i would love to meet people but i just cant break this barrier im an average or even slightly above looking guy in my early twenties right now i dont have any living soul in my life except for my parents it hurts so much watching people have friends and have fun to the point where i cant concentrate on anything else im usually at home and my hobbies arent very common im a huge music nerd so i dont go clubbing so its very hard to even see people and when i finally find a social event or something im interested in its just so frustrating and i cant possibly imagine a world where i would initiate the conversation with someone or ask a girl out or something plus people are already in their comfortable groups of friends and dont want to be disturbed by a stranger saying hi its just so much harder to meet people when youre alone even when it comes to apps for meeting people and stuff like that im terrified to talk especially to girls because of how insecure i am even if they want to talk to melike me sometimes i dont respond because maybe we have nothing to talk about or eventually they will realise what a loser i am crazy right and when i think about it i look fine and everything but the moment i step outside all i can think of is why would anyone want to be friends with me i screwed my life pretty badacomplished nothing so theres nothing about me to be proud of its just i feel like im throwing best years of my life and it eats me more and more everyday also needless to say ive never had a girlfriend or even came close i talked to therapist and nothing has changed,0
horse hi im f first of all im really sorry at least youre of legal age to get medical help on your own so please dont worry about what your parents think because you dont legally need them for this although it would be really helpful to have parents who care and understand more than helpful and its really fucking sad that they dont believe in mental health disorders it might be beating a dead horse if you talk to them and they still dont understand please know youre not alone at least and your problems are very valid dont let them tell you otherwise im not sure where you live but at least right now in america all of my therapy appointments are over telephone due to covid that will make it much much easier if not you can most definitely request to do phone appointments that is probably the best advice i can give and its what helped me i wish you the best of luck lt,0
nature this is a tricky one you feel like youre totally yourself when youre with your so but he feels like theres something missing and now its making you doubt your own identity if anyone should know when youre being yourself its yourself theres a possibility your so has created an idea of what he thinks you would be like in his head or perhaps your more introverted and reserved nature might make him think youre holding back but honestly human beings have so many different elements to their personality in a year there is no way you would know eachother inside out in fact a lot of people dont really get to know their so until theyve lived together so i would tell your so what youve said here in your post that you are being yourself but unless youre together all the time theres no way you can possibly show him every element of who you are its just something he will learn with time and new experiences you go through together,0
run omg i literally just asked this one guy why he wanted to be friends with me about weeks ago the dude had started talking to me almost out of nowhere last school year and nobody had ever done that for me his answer surprised me a lot he basically explained to me that hes just a social person and it had me run through so many things in my mind the mask part is what gives me even more anxiety theres so much at times that i want to express emotionally but i have too much anxiety to spit it out or show it thats when the anxiety of just dying to express what im feeling comes in and i just cant help the thought of being judged even when i know i wont,0
run i ended up getting hired at a sonic drivein and have been working there instead my job is going great my gm is very understanding as he also has anxiety issues and was only recently promoted to his position ive been working in the kitchen learning how to run the grill and fryer how to restock the reachin freezers how to clean the grill and filter out the fryer then clean it as well theres only about five guys in the kitchen during my shifts but ive generally gotten along with everyone ive worked with im working full time for hour have tuesday and saturday off the crazy thing is ive felt very little anxiety about the whole thing its a very laid back environment,0
outside i just failed my chipotle interview bc im socially awkward feeling like a total loser this is my first post here so im not sure how this works but anyway i just failed my chipotle interview today if thats even possible like how hard is it to fail a fucking chipotle interview but if youre me its probably very easy this was my first interview ever and probably my last this is also the first time stepping outside since quarantine and my last today has been nothing but embarrassment humiliation and the realization that ill never amount to anything in life bc of my crippling social anxiety the fact that i was confident and i prepared well yet once i got there all my confidence left me i looked like a fucking idiot being the only person wearing semiformal clothes yet other ppl wearing a literal tshirt and sweatpants did better than me and the fact that i was excited is more humiliating the interviewer couldnt even hear me and i had to repeat my name like dozen times to them and if thats not embarrassing idk what is the interview only lasted minutes im not joking they told me theyd call me afterwards but whats the point id prefer if they just outright told me that i didnt get the job its one thing to do well in an interview and not get the job but its another thing to completely fail humiliate urself in front of everyone and not get the job after the interview i came home depressed and wanting to just curl up into a ball and die i literally canceled all my future interviews since i dont feel motivated to pick myself up again after this failure this was just a reminder that ill never get anywhere in life because who the fuck fails a chipotle interview fast food has to be the easiest job to get out there and i couldnt even do it idek why im writing this at this point i just want to see if theres anyone out here like me or if im the only loser in this entire world,0
run i work at a grocery store people are always doing this so its really normal to me of course just try to read the situation dont run off to get something far away at the very end of the order when theres a long line behind you that makes the situation stressful for the cashier since the people on line will complain and give everyone a hard time i never feel upset at the customer for doing this though because it happens yknow and its not like it kills anyone to wait on line for a bit if you go shopping with someone else its always better to have them fetch an item while you finish up the order sometimes the cashier can hold your order and do other things while you get your stuff too if its really slow i prefer when people go to grab something that they forgot since i can just stand around and do nothing for a bit haha personally when i go shopping i will just pay for my stuff and wait in line again with my forgotten item no one judges you for this sort of thing we all do it as long as youre considerate no one will think twice about the situation,0
walk i said something to a cute guy im kind of proud of myself but also uncomfortable about the situation lol im at a hotel where some ppl speak english and i guess some arent as good and i was just looking at an art stop a cute guy walks up and tries to get in but the doors r locked so i say aw man its closed tsk he doesnt say anythig and starts walking away while looking back at me so i thought he was weirded out so i just played it off by walking away not looking at him lol maybe i didnt make it clear enough i was talking to him or idk lol,0
walk counselors talk you through it psychiatrists will prescribe meds though im not sure how much they also act as counselors either way i agree with the person that suggested seeing a psychiatrist first while it did make a difference to talk to a counselor it would have been much easier for me had i been prescribed something to take a bit of the anxiety away first i found myself being too afraid to do the things my counselor suggested i do and wasted a lot of time pretending that i was actually doing the exposure therapy first i went to the doctor and asked her to refer me to a psychiatristcounselor she said that she didnt know anyone and that i was on my own so that was kind of a bummer because going to talk to the doctor about it was difficult enough i ended up spending a couple months looking up a bunch of counselors online and found a lady that looked really nice her office was just a minute walk from my house and as i also have driving anxiety it was perfect i called her told her i preferred using email and we arranged the first appointment that way the first appointment was basically her getting to know me how old are you what do you do whats your family situation like she also made me fill out a form to determine whether or not i was suicidal or depressedi actually think i am depressed but none of the questions on the form applied to my symptoms but anyway after a few sessions i was more comfortable telling her things i found it difficult to express what i was feeling on the spot so i would write a list of things that i wanted to talk aboutexpress a few days before that really helped i went away a few months ago and stopped seeing her after that the sessions were very expensive and i felt like i could use the tools that she taught me and work on my anxiety on my own i do think talking to her helped initially and i would recommend it to you even just going through the process of searching for and calling a counselor will be beneficial to you it was for me,0
"running, runs i somehow am running a petition progress hey guys ive really only been suffering with social anxiety since the beginning of this school year am a current freshman in high school since it really ramped up and i started using homework as basically an excuse not to talk to people and when i needed to talk to people i was nervous couldnt speak felt awkward the works well last week i started a petition for a movement i was passionate about involving ap world history a class i took the company that runs it cut half the curriculum and i was angry lol so i started a petition assuming itd die after signatures and went to bed i woke up with signs as of today i have almost im doing frequent updates and even talking to people about the cause its terrifying but it feels awesome to have some success and because im a selfpromoting asshole heres the link",0

run severe anxietydepression im a year old dude diagnosed with severe depression borderline personality disorder and insanely crippling social anxiety for background reference my problems flared up when i was due to a tremendous amount of inperson and online bullying years later and im a complete mess with no real life experience since then ive done nothing but lose friends and my teen years were basically nonexistent instead of manning up and pushing forward i took the cowards route and retreated inside my shell and stayed in there but its not working for me and never really has i just havent stepped up and taken steps to actually mend any fences the most help ive received is when i was submitted to the psych hospital for a month after an attempted od nothing changed during my stay i didnt speak to anyone i kept to myself as much as possible i watched others come and go interact make friends watch movies together all while i confined in a corner i guess i find its easiest not to let anyone in because nobody can hurt you if you nail the doors and windows shut that was when i was now as a year old i live alone and associate with no one not anyone online and one or two people at most in person and i cant really blame anyone for not wanting anything to do with me its not like ive evolved and im not really witty what i am is sad and pathetic the very definition of i wake up watch tv eat quietly play on the computer playing a few games and never type anything to anyone sleep and repeat day in and day out days a year for the last years i dont know what its like to be normal all my childhood friends abandoned me when i first started to get picked on in grade suppose because youd be guilty by association and after that i threw in the towel the extent of my daily social interactions is maybe ordering a coffee or buying groceries if i can muster up the energy to leave the house to say i have a late start is an understatement i just got hired for my first job as a seasonal stocker in a week or two to be determined but ive never done any of the regular shit teenagers or young adults get up to i never shot the shit with friends never really had many to never been to a party never had a relationship never done anything a year old shouldve done by now im out of the loop so to speak im left to my own vacant mind all day empty thoughts to cope ive just kinda stopped thinking if that makes any sense i run on autopilot i dont commentate in my own mind i dont really have opinions or original thoughts ive shut down like a broken computer theres emptiness and numbness to the point where i cant even remember the last time i was genuinely happy or sad or anything aside from straightfaced my memorys fried brain might as well be a fried egg im depressing to be around unattractive morbid boring and extremely extremely lonely everyday the only thought that crosses my mind is offing myself i dont know why i havent already i find i cling onto this dream that maybe one day ill have a career and a purpose a boyfriend a family even a nice home i could invite buddies over to but all that is is a dream pure fiction at the same time im not all that educated or cant speak my mind very well because of how long ive been on low power as you might already be able to tell i cant describe how i feel inside im hanging on by a thread all i see are faults no redeeming qualities andxb i guess my question is has anyone ever experienced anything remotely similar to being so disconnected in a world thats more now than ever connected how can i even begin mending whats broken theres no real support systems where i live give or take cbt groups that ive done a million times in my past to no avail any advice would be greatly appreciated,0

run feeling unloved friendless and worthless in college tw depression anxiety i just came back yesterday from studying abroad even though it was an amazing experience it was probably the only highlight of my college career thinking about this makes me feel like a failure because i havent had the best four years of my life or found my lifelong best friends like everyone insisted i would growing up my shyness trust issues and social anxiety depression have ruined so many opportunities for me this really makes me feel worthless and i hate being reminded of it whenever older people mainly friends and acquaintances of my parents pester me about hows college and all my new friends i wish i could overcome these issues and move on with my life i am dreading coming back in september and even though this sounds pessimistic its more likely that i get run over by a bus than find someone who likes me and wants to be my friend and vice versa,0

stream does anyone have excessive metal noise i have a lot of trouble focusing on things due to a constant stream of different thoughts flowing through my head i believe its the reason i cant formulate conversation or do tasks that involve a lot of patience when in a class rather than focus on the lesson i start looking at other people and thinking about them or start doodling when at home all i do is sit and surf the web i have some artistic capacity but never draw in my freetime do to the focus it requires i only doodle when in a boring situation i cant escape i dont have the ability to stay dedicated to anything maybe this is the reason ive never been motivated to find a romantic relationship i cant participate in class discussions because im so absent minded i think this constant distraction is more of an issue than actually fearing people it get scared of talking because my mind is not in tune with the topic at hand and i know i will say something stupid or misguided becausr of that most people have an amazing capacity to channel out the world beyond the task they are doing at the moment i have never been able to function like that so i find it amazing does anyone else suffer from this,0
outside my teacher forced me to socialize im a th grader in high school around years old ive had social anxiety for about as long as i can remember and its always been a huge problem today in math we were doing a worksheet and the teacher told us to do it in groups of max i only have one friend in that class and other people seemed to be working alone so i decided to as well she then came up to me and asked me why i wasnt working with others i told her that i worked better alone and she told me to go find a group anyway i felt so awkward and the only people i knew in the class were already working in groups of i tried working up the courage to ask someone else but then panicked and ended up not doing it she gave me a huge lecture in front of the class about how i have to be more willing to collaborate with others and the entire class looked at me while i started halfcrying i sat with my friend for the rest of the period but i think i embarrassed her because no one wants to be forced to work with the awkward shy girl my teacher pulled me outside after class and tried to give me a therapy session she was really nice about it but i ended up crying in front of her anyway while her daughter who gossips a lot watched in the background i just feel so embarrassed i know its my fault for not socializing but i do t want to ever go back to that class,0
running my story on how ive got problems and of them are completely made up scenarios in my head that im stressing about for no logical reason social anxiety where do i begin i feel as if i know it that well i could write a series of novels on it you know where im coming from ill start from the beginning as far back as i can remember i was a normal kid i was very outgoing loved being the centre of attention and the class clown throughout school i was always their to make teachers and other students laugh whether it was by telling jokes or generally making a fucking idiot of myselfwhat im trying to get at is i was once upon a time a social kid when i left school i pursued a career in the construction industry bagging myself a plumbing apprenticeship and also working in a bar as a barman serving and interacting with customers a job i loved and the fact i would meet all walks of life every weekend and hear the storys they would have to tell my year old self at this point in my life everything was running smoothly and i can hold my hand up high and say i was fucking loving life and what it had to offer and i was looking forward to the future ahead fast forward a couple of years to april just after my th birthday i started dabbling in drugs with my friends now i wasnt hanging around with the wrong crowd id had the same set of mates since i was at high school and they were good nice lads we just got into the wrong things now id smoke the odd joint when i was a teenager but did nothing out the ordinary until a new legal high came around called mkat mkat fuck me if i could tell my year old self anything it would be to not touch this drug ever anyway everyone was doing it it was the new thing to do and everything was fine when i first started taking it and then after a while i would get paranoid and think people were speaking about me or looking at me funny then id go home sleep it off and i would be sound the next day other than having a shitty comedown but this one time this all happened i went home tried to sleep it off but it was as if something had clicked in my head i started getting nervous and anxious being around people i couldnt make eye contact with people anymore and couldnt hold a conversation with people for more than seconds i fucking started to hate small talk and would avoid all social events i didnt know what the fuck was wrong with me i googled my symptoms and it came up that i had social anxiety i though you fucker this is from that night you took mkat and hit paranoi youve havent clicked out of that anxious state of mind now i knew what i had i thought where the fuck do i go from here ive done hours and hours of cbt and theirs only so much they can tell you ive been on and off setraline for a year as i dont find it works but it seems to be the go to drug for people with a social anxiety disorder ive had to quit work and havent worked in over a year as i struggle to hold down a job and be around people theirs people in my life i feel comfortable around my dad mum and brother everyone else i cant look them in the eye or hold a conversation with before any social event i will drink before i go out as i find alcohol gives me that confidence i need to socialise with people i also use ketamine because as soon as i have some all the anxiety of being around people goes away now i know ive got my self into a terrible cycle and i cant go on like this all my life but what the fuck do i do ive tried cbt ive tried setraline ive tried going to the gym and getting fit have i thought about suicide every fucking day i just think their is nothing that will work and i will never be able to get back to that social teenager i once used to be im now barely leave my room and if i do i have to drink before i do this social anxiety has fucking crippled me i had the world at my feet and now well now i have a constant state of fucking worry anyway ive wrote this so if theirs anyone out their going though something similar your not on your own and if i find something that helps me with my social anxiety ill be sure to let you know i will one day get back to my normal socialising self hold down a job and friendships and one day love life for what it has to offer again this is the first time ive ever told this to anyone in such detail before as well,0
"outside, walk yeah that makes sense at the moment i only leave the house when i really cant avoid it and even something ordinary like going to a store and buy stuff is something i cant handle so i usually buy most stuff online i guess i should start with just leaving the house for a few times per week and later maybe every day even if its only for a few minutes if i ever want to get more comfortable in public its just really difficult to start doing something like that when you are so terrified of the world outside and always get a mini panic attack from silly situations such as walking past people or getting looked at but it seems like i have no other option than forcing myself into social situations school definitely was way too much for such an anxious and awkward mess like me the fact that i had almost no positive experiences at school doesnt help there for sure when i think of school i can mostly only remember painful moments where other kids treated me badly made fun of me or the whole social aspect of school i simply couldnt deal with",0
outside welp my anxiety caused an animal to suffer so this morning i woke up to the sound of an animal making a screeching noise and i didnt think anything of it because animals make weird noises all the time the sound stopped after a few seconds and i went back to bed well about half an hour later my dog wanted to go outside so i let him out and he darted straight for this area of the yard i followed him and it turns out that a poor rabbit got stuck in my chain link fence and couldnt get loose the skin on this poor things back had peeled away trying to get out the depressing thing is that it was still alive long story short i called each of my parents to ask what i should do and they both told me to call animal control or put the poor thing out of its misery im not the type thats capable of killing a wild animal so the only option was to call animal control thanks to the fact that i suffer from severe social anxiety which makes phone calls with strangers an impossible thing i paced around for almost minutes trying to breathe right and think of what to say before i called animal control now the part where i feel bad about this whole situation is that minutes before the animal person got to my house the rabbit died it was alive and calm trying to find a way out through the whole situation up until nothing i feel like shit i hate seeing animals suffer but im too much of a basket case to directly help them in a situation like this or even call someone to help them while i dont think it would have survived too much longer if it had been rescued i would have rather seen it die peacefully than trapped in a fence on a cold and gloomy day,0

"outside, walk i dont think ill ever be able to coexist with society ive been following this subreddits posts for a while now and i finally worked up the nerve to post here i keep seeing posts from people saying oh i have social anxiety and todays my first day on the job or im at college and i have sa or its hard to use public transportation its like some kind of sick joke i guess i must be some special case because to me i would kill to be in those positions at least you can go to college at least you have a job at least you can use public transport i cant do any of that stuff i havent left my house in months the outside world is too scary im years old and i still live with my parents ive never had a job ive never gone to college i never got my drivers license i dont have an id i cant talk on the phone i cant talk to cashiers i cant function in society as an adult at all i havent gone to a restaurant in a year and even then i had to go with my family and talking to the server gave me anxiety i havent gone to the dentist in years and i havent gone to the doctor in years i just think im so fucked i dont think ill ever be able to exist in society like a normal person i feel like a child stuck in an adults body everywhere i look people seem to be doing it every single day i dont know how they do it but somehow they do i get anxiety just from walking out in my front yard also ive been overweight for years ive recently started getting in shape and ive lost pounds since march it made me feel better about myself but there are some things that diet and exercise cant fix like my face which is very ugly that only contributes to my selfconsciousness which makes it harder to go outside which makes me stay inside longer which makes the outside world seem even more daunting its just a vicious cycle that never ends i just dont see any hope on the horizon im beginning to think its just not worth it anymore everyone on here seems to at least have some semblance of interacting with society whether it be school or college or work or whatever i guess i must be so removed from society that i dont even belong in it anymore it seems like no one can relate to my brand of social anxiety sometimes i think itd be easier to just end it all no more worries no more anxieties suicide is looking more and more appealing every day",3
outside my f anxiety is ruining me ive posted here once before so ill reiterate some of the things ive mentioned i was severely bullied through my late elementary schoolearly middle school years developed depression anxiety eating issues and general body dysmorphia all of these issues i still struggle with today however the most severe out of them is my anxiety i worry over everything no matter how big or small the most insignificant thing can send me off in a fit of nerves and panic im plagued with what ifs constantly ive avoided social events because of anxiety most of my daily life is fucked up due to anxiety my anxiety stems from the root of being afraid of messing up as a kid i taught myself to be a perfectionist if i did everything perfectly i wouldnt get in trouble if i did everything right and was perfect inside and out then my parents and friends and family wouldnt have to worry about me this has had a disastrous effect i cant go outside due to being so nervous of fucking up doing something stupid looking dumb etc ill get this knot in my stomach just thinking about going out with friends i cant talk to new somewhat familiar people because i get nervous that im not talking right or looking stupid or saying the wrong thing or just being overall disinteresting anything outside of my daily routine of workschoolhome fucks me up this also relates to new experiences im scared of dating im scared of sex whenever i think about these things i get this extreme burning sensation a heavy fit of nerves and i have to calm myself down because it gets so intense i hate going on vacations because i get the what ifs and at the end of the day i just count down to the day i can be back in the safety of my own home its killing me i hate myself at the fact i cant do regular things i dont have fun my life is so mundane and basic that it frustrates me but the anxiety and fear of the outside is what keeps me isolated i cant go places i cant talk to people i cant make new friends i cant live my life i cant take it anymore its not even the fact that i wont do it i physically cannot do it and its not like i can just shove myself out there ive done that before and its just made everything worse ive tried going out with a close friend and i hated it so much i just wanted to go home i thought about trying to go out with a friend and his friends but i feel like ill just fuck up and make a mockery of myself i dont know what to do,3

"walk, riding i hate being watched or observed any advice for this i decided that im going to try to get out of my comfort zone i went out for a short walk around my neighborhood just now i notice i have this intense fear of being watched or looked at during my walk i had cars riding by i hate when cars ride by me because i feel like the person driving or the people in the car are looking at me and judging me i had to walk near an intersection to get back to my house i dont like when cars are stopped at an intersection and i have to cross because i feel like everyone in their vehicles are staring at me and judging me judging the way i walk them sensing or noticing that im nervous or uncomfortable and judging me for it i also have a fear of catching my neighbors sitting on their porch i didnt catch anyone sitting on their porch during my walk however i have these thoughts like what if i see my neighbors sitting on their porch should i say hello to them should i wave what if they ignore me what if i dont speak and they think im ignorant or rude what if they think im weird i dont like being observed by people it makes me uncomfortable whenever my father observes me doing something he always judges or makes fun of the way i walk he tells me i walk very stiff because of that im selfconscious of the way i walk i always feel like people are judging the way i walk he gives me a hard time and gets angry with me for looking nervous or uncomfortable when were out sometimes this is why i always feel like people can sense that im nervous and are going to judge me negatively my father always tells me you have to always watch your surroundings when youre out you have to walk with your head up and your chest out you cant appear weak or scared because people will try to harm you if you appear vulnerable this is why im always a little paranoid when im out of my house or being watched by people because i dont want them to think im weak and i dont want them to treat me like im nothing because of it or try to harm me sorry if this is all over the place but all in all i hate being watched or observed by people this stems from a lot of the things my father tells me any advice would be appreciated",3
outside i have severe social anxiety how can i get rid of it its literally impacting my daily life so im years old and have social anxiety its gotten so bad to the point that if i leave the house to even go to somewhere like the supermarket or a store which most people would be able to go in with no problem if i go and i have to look anyone in the eye i start to have a panic attack and get head tremors its made me want to just stay in my house because going outside means if i have to interact with people ill have a panic attack and have head tremors this is impacting my daily life to the point that leaving the house is an effort please someone tell me what i can do about this therapy doesnt help and i dont really want to use medication,3
"walk, outside its hard for me to walk outside be it or people on the street i think it as a percentage thing more people means im less exposed but more people may look and judge me less people means im more exposed and its a much higher chance that the few people on the street are looking at me walking is the hardest part always had so many people say i walk like a penguin so ive had that in my mind every step i take outside since elementary school when i sit i feel more calm and like i blend in more",3

outside me and my anxiety i am year old person with social anxiety although it has not been diagnosed but after a lot of online research i came to this conclusion i also feel depressed and sometimes it lasts for months my depression comes and go this has been going on for at least years now my anxiety hasnt had any severe impact on my physical being i have been generally a good perfomer in terms of grades i also have a good paying job but socially it is as miserable as it can get i have zero social skills and i have a very hard time connecting with peoples i have had friends in college but i lost in touch with them everyone got busy with their own thing and also i started avoiding them although i made some friends at my work place but there was no real connection instead of calling them friends i should call them acquaintance i am also not very close with my family and i have no one to share these feelings with even the trivial things such as shopping and going out are very hard for me whenever i am surrounded by people i have a constant feeling of being judged i know this is all irrational and most of it is in my head so after working for years i thought its time to make some changes i made a brave decision of moving to a new city and taking a new job i was excited hoping that i would meet new people make some friends hopefully find someone special but it was quite the contrary i feel more miserable here the new job sucks people at my work place are not so friendly i dont know anyone in the city i dont think i have enough courage to go outside alone i just wanted someone to listen,3
"outside, walk ive developed social anxiety since moving to a foreign country back in my home country i did not have this debilitating sense of dread whenever i needed to go outside i have lived in asia and went to an international school since the second grade i had a lot of confidence in myself as well as a decent group of friends i still wasnt the most social guy but i had friends i could relate to i was able to go to malls shopping centres cafes and what not and converse with the cashierwaitress as a normal person would although i was a bit awkward since then ive moved to the uk for my undergrad and man ive basically become a shutin here i am too shy to make friends with the local students i feel like my english despite being good enough is different from the way its spoken in britain hence whenever i try to start a conversation my sentences tend to be incomplete and simply words strung together without a proper structure my selfesteem has suffered deeply because of this its been a year and a half now and its not getting any better im feeling a mixture of denial and knowing that i shouldnt feel this way because i could function normally back home as well as anger at myself because i just cant help myself to get out of this condition i refuse to acknowledge that i have a problem and i keep looking for reasons as to why i might be the way i am now heres how my daily life feels like to me i leave my apartment complex and walk to university on my way i feel that everybody is looking at me judging me for being so awkward and lame once i get to the lecture rooms people are conversing outside talking to each other while waiting for class to start i see people ive talked to before but for some fucking reason i decide not to make eye contact and sitlounge around alone i take out my phone hoping that nobody notices that i am a loner i walk into the class and am greeted by the sight and sound of hundreds of students in this massive lecture hall i try not to make a fuss about it but i am actually panicking about where i would be able to sit down without attracting attention to myself i finally find a place and a couple of people in a group decide to sit next to the empty spots next to mine theyre talking having a lot of fun asking each other about how last nights party was and what not and im just there probably theyre oblivious to me even being there once lecture finishes and classes are done for the day i immediately walk back to my room this walk back is often filled with bitterness and intense feeling of loneliness as i pass by other students walking with their friends the worst part of all this is that i cant figure out why i am the way i am now why could i function normally and live without fear back home but once here im afraid of the outside world im afraid of the eyes that arent probably even looking in my direction of the laughter i hear around me thinking that it must be at my expense while simultaneously knowing that it isnt i am stuck and i dont know why",3

outside please read hello rsocialanxiety i am reaching out to you to maybe get some tips about how to get out of this deep hole of social anxiety depression frustration and selfhatred ive been in for the last few years because the last weeks ive been getting progressively more hopeless and even suicidal i am currently years old and hate just about everything about me i had to drop out of school at age because of my social anxiety and daily panic attacks i stopped going outside completly i got rid of all my friends i havent seen a friend in about years now i have been sent to involuntarily inpatient a few times ran away from there a few times eventually the relationship with my mum got really bad and she kicked me out into my own small apartment she practically disowned me she doesnt believe in mental illness and thinks im just being lazy she just leaves groceries and water in front of my door once a week so i dont starve because i absolutly would prefer that to going outside i havent left my apartment in months now when i even think about going outside i get panic attacks and cant breathe i think a lot of my selfhatred comes from my obesity i dont think i can even change anymore my apartment is a mess because i barely have the energy to get out of bed i sleep all day or play games on the computer i need medical attention because i have an infection too which could kill me any day but i just cant see anyone without passing out from anxiety i currently think about killing myself and selfharm daily i truly hate myself and am so hopeless someone got tips,3
"outside, running medication might be the answer i recently got on a medication that helps with depression and anxiety and let me tell you it has made a huge difference of course it didnt completely cure me but it made being around people bearable before i got on medication i would wake up with dread knowing i have to go outside and interact with people once i got workschool i could feel a knot building up in my throat my body would get tense my chest would feel tight and my breathing became short i felt like everyones eyes were on me the paranoia would creep in and i literally felt like running i was isolating myself and never wanted to leave my house which caused me to fall into a bad depression now that im on medication those symptoms have gone away i am a shy person so i still get little nervous when talking to new people i feel like i can think more clearly when im around people and i feel a lot more relaxed ive come to terms that im not gonna be that social butterfly that everyone likes and im working on just being myself theres still some issues i want to work out with a therapist such as my low selfesteem and lowconfidence i feel like i sound like a commercial but please consider medication if your social anxiety is affecting your life also seek help from a therapist i know its scary ive been there social anxiety kept me from seeing a doctor but i got tired of being scared of people",3

bike i relate to this spiritually i used to do over the phone text support for apple and it was hell for me to figure out how to not be an awkward fuck on the phone but thanks to that job i developed my professional persona years later just turned and still relying on this persona to get me by when im at work i can click into this character and this character is basically composed of all the qualities i want to be all the time i can lead meetings control a conversation and just ooze charisma but at the end of the hours i go home and reflect on every slight social mess up ive had during the day every time i stuttered or wasnt ready for a question or didnt have a witty response to a comment or told a joke that fell flat i just sit and reflect reliving those moments over and over imagining what my professional character would do differently to handle that situation better and make new scripts and lines for those responses when im not at work i am almost like a different person i cant talk to any stranger gyms terrify me throwing a frisbee in front of someone i dont know is horrifying i cant ride a bike in public without feeling like everyones staring at me i dare not inconvenience anyone i seldom do anything alone so i can blend in better but the thing is i love doing things with people and meeting them but i just cant meet them as me until like years down the line before i take done the persona sorry i rambled a lot i just really related hah i love hanging out and meeting people i just need this facade to give me the confidence to do it my goal is to get rid of this bull honky persona because it is exhausting sometimes it feels like im lying to myself but i cant tell if its the socially anxious me lying about being scared or if the he out going me lying about being out going i dunno its all kinda stupid i feel you pal,3

jog had a looming realization last night ive had this habit for a long time of drastically underestimating my anxiety ill make plans to do things go on a jog go to the store etc i know ill have a lot of anxiety when i do these things but it is always so so so much worse when i actually do it i heard a quote recently i dont recall where something along the lines of humans are a species so quick to forget hardships that theyll never learn actually im pretty sure it was from one of the hunger games movies now that i think about it after having went to the store last night with the plan of while i was checking out at the register to ask if the store was currently hiring and having like cardiac arrest levels of anxiety i just really came to realize i need to be realistic and try something else for awhile i ended up not even asking i was just insanely anxious well beyond my threshold instead i just silently filled the swear jar to the brim under my breath on the drive home i have like immense depression as it is i feel im only worsening it day by day trying to scratch together the motivation to do shit like that ive been to a total of different therapist at one point i even had therapist at once sitting in the same room together with me im sure it depends on the person but for me id definitely say if anything therapy only worsened my depression one thing that i have found some sense of solace in in the past is watching a few select people on youtube just discussing there sa depression suicidal ideation ive thought about doing that for myself for a long time i think it would be more beneficial to me then therapy which i stopped going to several months ago ive basically been doing nothing with my time for the past several years it would at least be more progressive then anything ive tried if you can actually find somebodys videos you can relate to as rare as that is hell finding relatability with anybody whether youre both anxious depressed or not it can be such a comfort having that actually listening to somebody talk and not just reading a post makes it feel more real like its not so much just all in your head do any of you guys watch videos like that or even maybe thought about talking about your sa depression in a vlog yourself,3

outside i need some advice i am a year old female who has been struggling with depression social anxiety generalizedanxiety and ocd for years now it was triggered due to a couple major close deaths one right after the other i dont know how to handle grief and a continuous sexuality assault situation that really left me in a self loathing self conscious mess it would take me to go into complete detail but im going to explain some things quickly to get to my point it has gotten to a point where i can not hold face to face conversations i am afraid to even leave my bedroom in my own home that is shared by just me and my very supportive boyfriend i am afraid to go outside or even apply for jobs because i know i wont get through the interview and if i do even make it that far i leave the job or get fired because i just stop showing up im at a complete loss i feel like i have absolutely no control over anything i feel like an empty shell and that scares me i do convince myself to leave the house but only if my boyfriend is with me he has become a crutch that i just dont want to drop im afraid he will leave because it seems like i cant be independent of do anything on my own,3

"walk, running what is it hi im a year old male from the uk it has just hit me that i might be suffering from some form of social anxiety i know its not something you can easily diagnose as being shy is common and often just a stage in someones life but i think its more than shyness for me i can speak to other people fine and will smile at the barista or laugh with somebody if the situation is so so i wouldnt class myself as shy i can hold a conversation with a stranger well enough what i think is my problem is that i always feel like i have to prepare myself before i go out regardless of how well i think im dressed or whether i have a fresh haircut or whatever i feel unready to be in the gaze of others if im not physically and mentally prepared if i dont know that im being looked atam in the presence of others or if im not prepared mentally to be looked atto be in the presence of others i feel very uncomfortable dont ask me what my mental preparation is because i have no clue my physical preparation is fairly normal for a young male its just the mental side i also just always feel like im being watched when im walking in public like everyone i pass stares at me for a second longer than they do at other people because i dont fit in truth is i look normal im from an ethnic minority but who the hell cares about that especially at uni i dont think i look particularly attractive or unattractive the issue came to fruition in uni when i began to be out and about more generally i was a bit overweight but not by majorly so and my selfconsciousness with that made me hate being in public id want to be out of sight as soon as possible and it was like a massive burden was lifted off my shoulders when id reach my room since then ive lost a lot of weight so that im really like any other young adult male if a bit on the skinny side but thats because im into running and yet the feeling of being out of place still hasnt changed im still at uni in my final year and it has improved a lot losing weight helped and generally becoming more comfortable with how i look i think that was one of my major problems i was very self conscious with my looks i hated the way i looked with glasses because i thought it made me look even weirder to the extent that i wouldnt wear glasses when my prescription is such that i should wear them all the time id rather be basically blind and live in a blur than to look that extra bit weirder that continued on for a long while until i realised that it was affecting how people i knew thought of me because theyd pass right by me or wave at me and id blank them because i couldnt see them thats different now i think ive come to terms with my image i look different but im fine with that because we all do and im no beast or whatever im a lot more comfortable in public too and will go out even when i dont particularly need to but theres still that something that makes me falter before i go out in the morning and sometimes i dont even want to leave my room that is what has made me think that theres something more to my condition than just having body image issues theres no better feeling than getting back into my room and being out of sight after a long day at uni i read somewhere that this is just a symptom of being an introvert but i dont think i am your usual introvert i enjoy meeting new people and sometimes i really crave it its not social interactions that exhaust me because i get this need to hide away after simply being out and having not even talked to anyone so is this the right place for me do you think i have social anxiety issues i dont think it is the body image issues that ive had in years gone by but then again ive never really looked for professional help for anything like this i dont know honestly id just be glad if there was someone else who had the same issues someone that i could to talk to about them thanks for reading all of that its the first time ive ever actually typed out my feelings about it and really is a relief in itself so thanks for being a part of that even if there is nothing you can suggest",3
"outside, walk i cant bring myself to go outside maybe if im going out for a walk in the rain at am okay but even that makes me anxious and paranoid asf the exact opposite end of that spectrum is being in a group environment like group therapy or talking face to face with some professional about any kind of health issue even with headphones its just not the feeling of possibly having to talk to someone but just being seen by someone even if they dont know me or want to talk to me just being looked at i just cant do it i dont want a gofundme i already feel like a financial burden thats all i am i want to feel accomplished and like i was able to pay for something myself i dont want donations or handouts from others i dont really deserve them in the first place nor do i think that if i did that people would actually be able to donate enough to pay for online therapy for any reasonable amount of time",3
"running, walk, beach, run to me in some ways it lessens in others its more like ups and downs some places if i stop going ill be anxious again as if its the first time other things like running everytime i go out of my apartment and walk the path until the beach i feel anxious and uncomfortable or its mild anxiety but still bothersome after idk how long i still dont feel comfy about it funny is that after i run i dont feel that uncomfortable at all",3
"walk, grass my social anxiety i wrote this as a bit of a vent for myself but thought i would post it here because im sure many of you can relate to this its a bit long but here goes as a kid i was always shy i wouldnt make direct eye contact with people most of the time i would put my head down in situations where i had to meet new people at family gatherings i would mostly keep to myself only talking to people if they asked me a question even then it would usually be a short response in school i didnt have many friends i had more in elementary than i did in middle school more in middle school than in high school i can count the number of real friends i had in high school on one hand it sure didnt help that i went to three different high schools throughout my high school years one of those i left and returned to a few times i changed elementary schools in the th grade and then changed middle school in the beginning of th grade so it didnt make it any easier to make friends with people that already had established groups of friends that they had grown up with i remember hearing this girl in my class talking to her friends about how it was weird that we keep leaving and coming back we being my sister and i in high school people thought i was rude or mean because i didnt talk to anyone the truth is i just didnt know how i wanted to have friends i didnt want to be popular or anything but who doesnt want to have their own circle of friends and people to relate to even the people i dated didnt get to know the real me because i was too afraid to be myself i dont know why i felt this way im sure it has something to do with my developmental years but im not an expert going to school every day was hell thinking that everyone is judging you all the time or talking about you or laughing at you is rough being made fun of for being too skinny or too quiet or too rude is rough i would walk in every morning with headphones in and make a beeline for the classroom and i would leave the same way i wonder if you know what this social anxiety feels like it can come and go at anytime some days are worse than others some days its insomnia heart racing palms sweating mind racing its uncontrollable and it feels like youre mind is going to explode from the craziness inside it some days it lurks in the background on those days its manageable you can go to the movies or to the mall and feel somewhat okay some days its canceling plans youve had for weeks because you just cant bring yourself to leave the house and face human interaction you cant face the feeling of everyones eyes on you and the negativity that you assume is associated with you you cant force yourself to act like youve got it together in front of other people its too hard to put on a smile and make conversation the hardest part for me is self doubt im always second guessing what im doing always thinking someone is watching always afraid of messing up its also people thinking im lazy because i dont work and when i do it never lasts too long even the job i have now which is a good job with good pay its hard its hard forcing myself out of bed in the morning knowing for the next twelve hours im going to be mentally exhausted which is much worse than the physical exhaustion that may seem like an over statement to you but its not for me walking down the long walk ways at work hoping no ones walking the opppsite direction what do i do when i cross someones path do i make eye contact do i look straight ahead do i smile nod wave am i rude if i just look down or away these are all thoughts going through my head as irrational as they are theyre real what happens when everyone is standing in a group talking do i go and try to be part of the group but then i have to talk to people but if i dont i just look like a weirdo or like i think im too good to talk to them what if i think i know how to do something at work but im not sure and im afraid to mess up so i ask someone for help then i feel dumb because i shouldve just done what i thought was right in the first place sometimes i avoid doing things altogether just so i cant fail and look dumb in front of my co workers but doing nothing also makes me look lazy and like im not a team player do you understand the problem this is also the reason i dont drive i know im capable of driving and would probably enjoy it but im terrified of taking the driving test i cant bring myself to go and be on the spot like that i dont even want to drive in front of my fianc so how am i supposed to do it for a test in front of a stranger everyone tells me you need to get your license its such an obvious and easy thing for everyone else but for me its the hardest thing in the world its the same reason i wouldnt cut the grass when i was younger i didnt want people to watch me out in the front yard anyone passing by could and i didnt want to mess up and cut it poorly i hope this will help you understand what this anxiety is like for me its not getting better in fact its gotten worse im getting more general anxiety now unreasonable worrying about things i have no control over checking to see if my loved ones are still breathing when they sleep or worrying about getting into car accidents living with this anxiety is getting harder and harder all i want to do is give up and just lay in bed at home in a safe place all the time im looking into getting help because this is too much to handle and i just want to feel normal for the first time in my life thanks for reading",3
"outside, park, walk giving up driving there are a couple of things that trigger my anxiety people rarely get mad at me but when it happens even when unjustified it saddens me and entirely ruins my day also im living in my parents home for years and although i know very few neighbors i feel stalked outside and its like everyone knows who i am the building complex is in a deadend street and all the windows make me anxious i took my license months ago and i usually drive as safely as i can my problem comes from some drivers the other day i was honked at while stopping at the stop sign today i was leaving schools parking lot when i gave way to other students one looked at me in complete disgust while passing by the other laughed at me i even considered if i made some mistake an hour later i parked in my street and went home i occasionally heard some honks outside and it made me realize i was missing something i found someone pulling my windshield wipers up so i parked a bit more inclined to the road side than to the sidewalk these are small streets and people usually park in the sidewalk and other car couldnt pass to the end of the street i could barely handle the looks while closing the wipers and parking again this is probably the stupidest reason to stop driving but i cant picture myself inside that car ever again ive made some other minor mistakes but my impression of being stalked has risen even more most people in my country are not rude but the looks i get while walking outside are somewhat the opposite to the anger i feel from some drivers the truth is that i cant deal with mistakes that require to be solved socially and i found it through a terribly expensive experience",3
"walk, outside why am i like this hi everyone im a year old software engineering student who feels funny saying that because i dont go to lectures and failed my last year because i didnt even go to exams i have such grand ideas that i dont seem to have the energy to follow through with ive barely left the house apart from for school food etc since i was about years old i spend all day on the internet and cant even tell you what exactly ive done all day because every day melts into the next i used to be so sociable fit and happy now i just glide through life day to day always in the same numb mood i cant seem to conjure up the sense of immediacy for things that are important to me as i used to i seem to find it easy to skip things that are important to me only to put it out of my mind minutes later i have this big project idea only to barely have the energy to work on it and to later abandon it ive always found it easy to make friends only in the last few years drift away from them because i can never find the nerve to go out i remember a very specific moment in my first year of university where a friend asked me to go to his birthday night out i had this weird thought in my head like he was trying to trick me to laugh at me obviously this was silly but these thoughts have become more intrusive since i can be walking outside and hear people laughing and i immediately worry if theyre laughing at me i hate being like this i sometimes kid to myself that i like life this way but the truth is i just dont think about the day to day putting whatever is wrong out of my mind seems to be my coping strategy today i was going to phone the doctors for an appointment so i could explain my situation but i ended up not doing it because once again i convinced myself that theyll say im overreacting and that im being lazy and just need to try harder i know this isnt true because my behaviour is not okay but i seemed to convince myself anyway sorry about the ranty post but i just needed to do this",3

"roller blade, outside , roller blades i got social anxiety trying to roller blade so i am years old for some random reason i have been wanting roller blades and i havent had roller blades in years so i finally got some and went to try them out this evening i went down to the parking lot of my apartment building got on my feet realizing that i may have forgotten how to roller blade and slowly make my way down the sidewalk as im rolling i hear a man in the parking lot say i see you rollerblades immediately loosing focus i veer off to the rocks almost breaking my face the guy calls out asking if i need help and i say no thank you he continues to offer assistance saying how he doesnt want me to fall and i realize i cant run away because ive got the dang roller blades on i fall again and he and his two friend come towards to offer help me around the corner but i say no thank you but im just practicing the original guy still offering help starts kind of flirting saying how hes the type of guy to make sure i dont fall i make my way away and fall behind a bush i take off my roller blades walk up the back stairs so that they cant see where i am going and go back to my apartment i was probably outside for a total of minutes the moment the guy spoke to me i wanted to run now he and his friends werent creepy about it they legit saw me struggling and didnt want me to demolish my face and the guy who offered to help in the first place was actually pretty cute i really hate how my anxiety kept me from trying more on my roller blades which ive been wanting to do but also made me miss out on interacting with some seemingly nice people in my neighborhood i just cant figure out how to overcome the urge to run away from any interaction",3

Jogging if you look for the light you will find it if you look for the dark it is all you will ever seennmy first semester of college i tried really hard to get over my sa while i ended up making progress it wasnt as fast as i had hoped and i still had a lot of trouble doing some things such as jogging in public i ended up getting pretty depressed and the next couple of semesters were pretty much failures as i lost my motivation i was eventually able to get back on my feet again partly because i was forced to interact with some people in a group projectnnsa isnt something that can be overcome quickly it is something that you have to overcome step by step inch by inch and there will be setbacks but that is okay focus on the small victories such as actually going to a club rather than the small failures not being able to talk,3
"outside , outdoors eye contact being in public i cant do it hi im thought i was just introverted and quiet but well its more like im scared as well as quiet which i guess just makes me quieter than i already am i mean im loud and extroverted with very few people who im close with but thats it but i dont go outside much its not that i dont like the outdoors its just the fact that theres other people that probably sounds stupid the only reason i really go out is because i have school which i absolutely hate thing is it feels like people state at me i usually walk looking down with headphones just to avoid any of it but sometimes ill look up for a second and meet eyes with someone and it feels like ive committed a crime or something also if im walking behind someone theyll keep looking back which just makes me feel like a stalker and makes me overtake them as if to prove im not but it also makes me feel guilty for some reason i only really wear headphones because it means i think anyway that people will be more likely to leave me alone but strangers seem to like talking to me and the headphones make it more awkward than it should be because i didnt hear the first half of what they said to worried to ask them to repeat it so i just nod i can hardly speak to anyone who isnt friend or family whenever im introduced to a friend of a friend i leave the worst first impression possible and then just avoid that person at every opportunity well not just a friend of a friend just with anyone who i dont know i was just thinking of a specific example even though it was a year ago im told that eye contact is a normal thing to do and people expect it and its rude not to do it somehow but the longest i can do it is like seconds before i absolutely have to look away my parents sometimes say things like youve gotten over your shyness but thats just not true sorry im going to stop before this gets to long",3
"runs, run, running crippling fear of exercise may actually cause me to get type diabetes hi first post on this sub im butter how are you alright anyway my family is at an extremely high risk for type diabetes runs in the family or whatever im prediabetic at age gym teachers made fun of me when i ran in elementary school i was always the last kid in the grade to finish the humiliation i felt when everyone was watching me panting and wheezing cheering me on to finish the last lap of the yearly mile at age really screwed me up they had no ill intentions i was just so embarrassed i dont run i cant do it and i hate every minute of it i dont exaggerate at all when i say that i would rather be marked as skipping every single day of the week and serve out all detentions than run the mile at school i dont run a few years back i got the majority of my spine fused i have no flexibility from the end of my neck to just above my lumbar i dont know how i look when i try to exercise or dance i just feel weird like i cant move without looking jerky and awkward because of this my belief that everyone is staring at me all the time no matter where i am and my fear of running i dont exercise in public at all i would exercise at home but i know my parents will make fun of me the have no ill intentions but they arent able to hold a conversation about anything without making fun of it trying to have them stop will result with them getting defensive and argumentative so im not doing that if i ever exercise i do it when nobody is home in the basement with the doors locked times like that are rare so sticking to a schedule is hard how do i exercise without having what little mental comfort i have left falling to shambles",3
"outside, walk m live abroad is killing me hello reddit i moved to europe when i was my mother already lived there for years and i lived in ukraine with my grandparents i was never really asked if i wanted to move but i also didnt think about living in other country and leaving everything behind as a big problem first half of the year was a horror i spoke to almost no one i learned german for a year prior to moving to europe and it was not enough for me to instantly make friends also the last couple of years at school in ukraine were pretty difficult for me as i was constantly bullied i was weak and skinny and didnt know how to protect myself but even then i didnt have any other problems outside school so back to europe from my first days here i tried to speak to my new schoolmates as good as i could but i also started to shield myself from people like if i try to look unfriendly or dangerous nobody will try to make fun of me i behaved myself like this when i was in public its not like i was being impolite to people but i tried to always have this dont mess with me look if this makes any sense however knew country new rules i didnt have to be afraid of being attacked physically instead i couldnt argue or counter jokes from my classmates this time i was vulnerable not because i was weak but because i didnt know the language well i also went to a second school simultaneously my week looked like this twice a week a returned home at pm because of two schools where i hadnt time to go home between them the rest of time i had to study my first winter holidays which i spent back in ukraine were both a relieve and a horror i had to go privately to a german teacher almost daily in first summer i had about teachers to prepare me for both schools all this was awful but stilly i had my friends at home and was overall happy until one day it started i was going back from my german teacher who was a really nice person and who taught me really a lot grammar that helped me immense with my german so its not like i totally hated learning german but lets go back so i was going back from my class i was a usual way for me just a bit uphill along the road towards the bus stop suddenly it was more difficult for me to breath and i felt like if i would start breath more people would notice it and that i looked really awkward after that i drove back home and felt myself completely normal but this situation repeated itself more and more during that summer i started to notice the way i breathe even on my way to the teacher i think this is where it all started as i was back in europe i started being conscious about how i move my feet or my arms i was always aware of where i was looking at how my lip was positioned i didnt know how to look in peoples eyes whether i looked unfriendly etc i still had no friends at european school i havent had any walks which i had constantly with my friends back in ukraine it looked like the kids where either going out the way i didnt understand or the didnt do it at all years went by the only time i enjoyed my life was when i had winter or summer holidays and was back in ukraine there i could talk to people i even managed to make new friends with whom i still have good contact i just felt myself normal after about years later i managed to tell my mother that something was wrong with me its not easy for a kid to admit that something is wrong with his head and i didnt have a good connection to my mother at that time she took me to her psychiatrist i was prescribed with some weak antidepressant i guess i helped with my mood a bit but it had done shit to my social anxiety i just tried to suppress the way i felt and had from time to time breakdowns my only dream was to finish school and university and leave that fucking country since no one here needed me i decided i would manage everything on my own i finished both schools it may sound like it isnt bad after all well no all this time it felt like i lost that autopilot and had to manually control the way i move or where to look at the person i speak to i still didnt feel connected to people around me i could not make jokes which the class would find funny i didnt speak to anyone outside my class i felt isolated and people around me perceived me the same way i wasnt interested in my future carrier or in what to study my only dream was to leave this country instead of leaving i thought that it would be a waste to give up an opportunity to study in europe i also didnt want to disappoint my relatives and to be honest i was afraid to change anything go back home and take exams to be able study there i also didnt want to look like an idiot coming back when everybody else wanted to leave ukraine for better future i think i should have done that if not for studying but just to have a year off relax get rid of sa and may be come back to study its important to mention that most of the social anxiety symptoms weaken after i get back home for at least a month but even from the first day on i always felt myself a lot better but i havent done that instead i thought i could power myself thought university get a bachelor and leave this fucking country forever i tried studying two different faculties i hoped that at the university i would finally able to connect to new people and have fun so that i would even decide to stay in europe that never happened i tried to study mechanical engineering but from the beginning the math was just unmanageable for me and i couldnt find a group to study together well if i cant have fun talking to someone new since i am to anxious i cant fit in a group to study because you must speak there and like make friends in europe there are no persistent classes at the universities you either have a lection in a huge auditorium or have smaller classes with persons for something like practicing math where you must solve your prepared homework in front of whole group i had to do it twice and i felt almost like i am fainting the most time i spent at home where i didnt have to feel constant fear and be in fight or flight mode during one summer in ukraine i met my current girlfriend later i decided to study cs at a socalled university of applied science where after three years of fixed classes i would have my bachelor and could go back to ukraine i had to wait almost a year to sign me up for that university in the meantime i found a job where i am basically all levels of support and a junior sysadmin at same time back in european school a had a specialization in it because of which we had one year more of school and the specialization made me hate it so much that i didnt realize that i actually like it the job was fantastic the only problem was that every year in august they organized an event for different political technical economical etc topics and i had to be there for month during that time i had both to do it stuff and help prepare everything for the conference cheap student labor d but that one month of constant work not just crushed me my anxiety escalated to some new levels i was constantly stressed i was still extra anxious after work but also looked forward to study something i wanted the way i thought could be the best for me i expected that only mathematics would be hard for me but i also knew you that it would not be as difficult as in a normal university i was so fucking wrong about everything the amount of information was huge we had constant projects in most of the classes moreover there are supposed to be a lot of group projects the groups where created all by themselves i didnt want to be that person without a group and be assigned to somebody i didnt like all of this made me extremely anxious additionally to my social anxiety i became anxious about everything else i had to finish every assignment otherwise i would fail either the final project or the test and then after repeat i would have to repeat the semester and if you didnt manage to do the first assignment you will still have to do it since every next assignment is built upon previous but most important i could not manage to make social contacts i was truly afraid of people it seems like we have no similar interests i still do not know how to connect to them people in europe just feel so alien to me here in europe at my university i felt like a totally different person i had a lot of breakdowns i started to cry in the evening and i somehow managed to survive till end of the december and have two weeks off during which i had to prepare for math exam but still i was in ukraine with my girlfriend what was really killing me is that i still can perfectly speak to my ukrainian friends we can argue discuss stuff make fun of each other etc i have a very nice and understanding girlfriend i have no problems socializing with them or even with meeting new people in ukraine after final exams my girlfriend was here with me in europe and i still could not relax when we were in public i constantly was afraid that i cannot protect her due to my sa i also failed two exams and had to retake them after holidays which made me even more anxious my doctor gave me some new medication which for two weeks seemed to lower my social anxiety and it felt awesome i already lost my belief that there could be any meds that could really help me and that belief was restored the only thing i feared is that it wont hold like with all previous things that seemed to help me and well it didnt hold something happened during the weekends i cant explain what it is but it set me off my fear became true the amount of work for the university increased even more and became unbearable to me at this point i cry for hours last week i spent home constantly anxious at this point i dont know what to do i should have left this country for a year after school now i feel like i cant do it i also feel like i am already too old to stop studying and make a pause i dont think that i will be able to finish this semester since i have already fallen behind all the classes i also get very anxious if i try to study and more anxious after every minor difficulty my relatives think that it wasnt that bad previously i think i just was very good at suppressing it and just cant take it anymore when i felt myself worse i was usually prescribed new medication talked to the therapist after that i felt a bit better and it was enough to continue suppressing and working on more important things how long can a person live in a foreign country feeling lonely i know that there are people to whom i am interesting who like me and care about me my family is also very supportive but its not them who feel anxious about going outside its me who is constantly afraid of masses of people who cant relax outside and cant protect myself from any verbal or nonverbal assault it almost feels like i am at a warzone i remember when i didnt care how people look at me ignored if somebody was rude to me i was able to respond the way i wanted my head wasnt empty now i just slowly fall apart i am not suicidal i guess because i dont believe in the afterlife and am afraid of death hell i even was more relaxed during this two weeks in ukraine in winter it wasnt enough time but i felt myself free on the streets you probably gonna say why the hell wouldnt i leave i know people would support my decision i could probably come back later but i dont wont to let down my girlfriend even if she says i dont i didnt finish a university so nobody would really want to have me work for them and i want to work so that i wont be an abuse i know my options i just dont have the will to make a decision i feel like i would get better a bit like usual and would continue ignoring the problem and maybe in years will slowly finish cs at the university i just dont think it is going to be a life maybe you together with my girlfriend it would be easier i dont know why am i even writing this i dont know whether its a right subreddit even posting something on the internet makes me anxious i do not know what i want to hear from you therefore i will just share this story and hope for something i also hope i wont be deanonymized by somebody i just feel like for the last years i lived only episodically not being able to open my true potential or take the opportunities i was given and i feel like i am slowly going insane i hope that this text isnt totally unreadable since i guess english is not even my second language i tried to keep it as short as possible but i also dont expect that anybody would like to read almost k words text tldr a lot of autobiographical stuff moving abroad as a kid literally ruined my nervous system as the years passed by and my will was never strong enough to

between who i am in one country and who i am in another is just killing me",3
outside social anxiety road to recovery social anxiety is an awful mental health disorder having suffered from it since i was i understand how debilitating it can be to just go outside and how the fear before just doing the simplest of tasks can make you feel i am making this post because although i know this subreddit tends to be mainly memes and jokes and i love it for that we do all share one common thing we all sufferdo suffer from social anxiety and for many this post will be useless but when i first subscribed to this subreddit id never done anything significant to truly address and deal with my mental health i had a feeling of hopelessness that i no longer have and if i could go back in time and give these words to myself i would if this post can help just one person then ill be happy but right in the last year i met a girl i struggle with going to university but i need a future she made me need to get better and i wish i had the self control to make myself force myself to take steps in getting better i know for a fact there is someone reading this who hasnt taken these steps to try and improve their social anxiety because the social anxiety itself prevents people from doing so getting help involves speaking to say a doctor or a therapist and this can be a massive scary deal so with having social anxiety it can be tremendously difficult to take the first steps to recovery this is unique in that suffering from a mental disorder such as ocd or depression doesnt necessarily restrict you seeking help in the sense of being unable to get yourself on your own to see a doctor or a therapist however you have to want to get better you have to know that you deserve better that social anxiety is not normal is not something anyone should suffer with and that it is a strongly researched mental health disorder which is legitimate and known by every health professional you need to enforce this desire and you have to make a doctors appointment this will create a dialogue with your gp you have to see what support is there for you your gp speaks to hundreds of people every week with a whole host of different issues both physical and mental mental health is a massive public health issue and is finally being treated as such see your doctor doing this was the best thing i ever did even though i was terrified when i had my first appointment i am not ashamed to admit that i had some alcohol before going thought about cancelling in the week leading up to the appointment and was just downright terrified of going but i did i said that i had anxiety in social situations and guess what he understood doctors dont judge i was put on a small dose of medication was a bit weird for the first few days as it made me lose my appetite and feel a bit weird but it settled you dont notice the affects of anxiety medication too much it takes about weeks for it to have any affect its likely youll also have your dose increased after your body settles on it it can feel like a long process you just want to stop having these feelings of anxiety of dread of fear going somewhere and having the physical symptoms of your anxiety presenting themselves and embarrassing you but its just the first step to getting better medication can work some say it doesnt work for them but it definitely makes some difference for some and i am living proof of that next therapy i wouldnt have been able to do a single therapy session if it werent for medication some will be able to and if you are great secondly money i live in the uk and here the nhs offer therapy for free if the patient needs it so im lucky in that sense although the waiting list was months i am aware that in many countries therapy isnt cheap however even where money is tight please realise that your mental state is so important and is absolutely worth spending money on in looking to improve it social anxiety is not normal and is not something you should have to be subject to every day you deserve to get professional help for those who literally cannot afford therapy i sincerely apologise and ask you to see if there is anything you can do to get the help you need therapy is scary at first but its also the best thing ive forced myself to do you become familiar and comfortable with a therapist they understand social anxiety they put you at ease and remind you that this is their job and that they deal with patients with social anxiety every single day these are things you can do that will make an improvement to your social anxiety it will make your quality of life better and it is absolutely worth doing you only get one life on this earth dont live yours in the shackles of social anxiety because you deserve better support is out there,3

park why cant i leave the house something that im guessing is anxiety drives me to the point where i stay home and play video games everyday ive been wanting to go to the gym park but i cant pinpoint this feeling of being a little afraid to go im not sure why that is because i do enjoy going out maybe ive grown use to the habit of staying home not sure why i have to try so hard to convince myself to leave the house,3
outside i felt this one thing im always afraid of when going outside is to meet people that i know especially those of my age,3
walk has your anxiety gotten worse as you got older or was there a time where you used to be normal my anxiety began to get worse six years ago when i was during my freshman year of high school i began to have a hard time making eye contact with people becoming a peoplepleaser being overly sensitive to how people look at me wanting everyone to like me being selfconscious about the way i walk being unable to relax in public walking into a room full of people going out for a walk getting nervous driving in the car because i feel like other drivers are staring at me and judging me etc before this i didnt have all these problems i was able to live life more comfortably and i was able to make friends and enjoy social interactions towards the end of my freshman year of high school my anxiety just got severe one day out of nowhere and it got bad from there i have gotten a bit better since then but i am still not at a place where i want to be at i miss the days when i was able to enjoy life more without being nervous all the time when i look at old photos of my self during this period i cant help but cry because it brings me back to a time when i enjoyed life and was much happier than i am now i just want to know if any of you guys can relate,3

"outside, walk im suffering with debilitating social anxiety i feel like im going to spend the rest of my life living in fear hello this is going to be a little long but please take the time to read this i dont know what to do im not trying to gain sympathy or pity i just need to pour my heart out im im a boy i have social anxiety its something i struggled with my whole life in school i was always quiet because i was very shy students used to always ask me why are you so quiet teachers would call my parents and tell them your son is very quiet my parents would get mad at me because of it when we would visit family i was always quiet and in my shell they would ask me why are you so quiet you can open up i was always shy and uncomfortable around family i didnt see very often my father always scolded me after we visited his family for being so quiet and acting uncomfortable around them i spent a lot of time in the house my father never liked that he always wanted me to go outside and play with the other kids in the neighborhood but i never wanted to out of fear he would always give me a hard time for always being alone and not having friends he would say youre always alone you have no friends i know i dont have any friends and im always alone it was very hurtful to listen to him and hear that but hes right the truth hurts he still says it to this day i would talk to people in school but i would never hang out with them outside of school i couldnt take that next step and people never wanted to hang out with me anyway they would never ask me if i wanted to hang out with them they never asked for my phone number i could never open up to people i was always awkward and uncomfortable with other students in school they definitely picked up on that i went to the same school district since third grade and i dont have a single friend from there my anxiety hit rock bottom out of nowhere during my freshman year of high school it could be attributed to the fact i was going through puberty and my hormones were raging or it just progressively got worse i started developing so many issues that were not a problem prior i started having a hard time making eye contact with people being sensitive to how people look at me if i get dirty looks from someone or a weird look i feel like something is wrong with me and im devastated when im out for a walk and someone is approaching me i either put my face down and look at the ground to avoid eye contact or i try to make the effort to make eye contact with the passerby but they just look at me funny and i feel awkward going out for car rides and feeling like people in other cars are looking at me and judging me going out for walks with other people around people noticing that im nervous or uncomfortable and judging me for it walking into a room full of people with all eyes on me always feeling like people are staring at me and judging me just so many issues that became so severe i always had anxiety but during my freshman year of high school my anxiety got much worse prior to this my anxiety wasnt that bad i was more carefree it was easier for me to interact with people i was able to enjoy life more the issues i started developing werent much of an issue in the past i became so upset that my anxiety gotten worse i let my mind convince myself that im never going to get better im doomed to have social anxiety for the rest of my life im never going to be able to go back to how i was before my freshman year of high school going out period around other people became too anxiety inducing for me so i became a shutin i went through the rest of high school with debilitating anxiety during sophomore year i started eating lunch in the counseling office because eating in the cafeteria with all the other students became too overwhelming for me i always walked with a book in my hand for a comfort i was and still am very selfconscious of the way i walk people say i walk very stiff or like a robot going to school everyday made me extremely nervous sitting in the classroom amongst other students and feeling like everyone is staring at me walking the hallways giving presentations high school was hell however i made it through and i graduated i started college and i didnt have the college experience i struggled with anxiety i just stayed in my dorm all day and did nothing i didnt make any friends join any clubsorganizations party etc i was too afraid to open up i was too afraid to step outside of my comfort zone and make friends and just have fun people would try to be my friend but i was never comfortable everyone around me was having the time of their lives making friends etc it was depressing because i wasnt having any of that i dont even want to go back to school next year i have no life i just sit in the house all day everyday i dont work because im too afraid to get a job how am i going to get through the interview what if my coworkers wont like me what if my manager wont like me what if customers or my coworkers think im weird because im socially awkward i try to get out of the house but being out just makes me nervous i want to have friends and i want to have a life i feel like i have so much to offer i just need to get past this awful fear i go on social media and look at people i went to school with they are having the time of their lives while i sit on my behind and do nothing its upsetting i have no personality i feel like a robot everytime i interact with people in public im very stiff and robotic people tell me im extremely nice but honestly i feel like i have no personality i cant open up to people im never comfortable and im always on edge im living in fear i just feel like im doomed to have social anxiety for the rest of my life it has gotten so severe to the point where i dont think i can ever recover sorry for the long post but i needed to pour my feelings out im sick of people telling me im just a lazy bum people dont know that im suffering with debilitating anxiety thats affecting my life any advice will be appreciated",3
"running, walk need advicefsocial anxietynew countryno friendsno independencelanguage barrier ruining myself and relationship i dont know where to start or what to say or how much to say but all i know is that i need help long story short i moved countries for my boyfriend and a couple years later and i think ive gained some unhealthy habits and i have huge social anxiety now and feel completely vulnerable and alone and its ruining my relationship as well as myself here is some more background info for anyone who may be able to give me any good advice i would really appreciate it im a yr old female and i fell in love a couple years ago and moved countries for my boyfriend we are still together and i believe things are much better than before you have no idea how hard this move has been on me i used to be so happy and outgoing and have my close few friends and old high school friends i used to do my own thing i used to be so independent first let me say that i love my boyfriend incredibly and we both plan to spend the rest of our lives together and have a family build our home and we are already working on our business together it has been a couple years and i still dont know how to speak the language here i do not have a car or a drivers license and i work from home i feel i am so reliant on him for everything i feel i am so needy and attached to him always we spend every day together and yes we take our space but i wouldnt want it any different now with the crime etc here and with how i stand out we both arent comfortable with me taking the bus let alone running in the area we live this is another problem i know a group of people that speak english and we sort of get along but i feel no matter what i do not click with any of the girls here i have always had troubles being friends with girls though they dont seem to take a liking to me and ive accepted that and continue to be as nice and genuine as possible i used to have a bunch of guy friends but now that i am in a serious relationship i should note this is my first relationship i dont think that it is very appropriate to make close guy friends but i get along well with my boyfriends friends though with the language ive been excusing it and excusing it and now that i live here i feel i have become shy because i hate being laughed at for not knowing the language i get so much anxiety when we are out and there is lots of people and my boyfriend is talking to people i dont seem to recognize or know or even people i do know and its in their own language and i just close in and feel so alone and so invisible to everyone i try to learn a bit but guess i get frustrated and shut down easily i am forcing myself to pay for on private lessons though and i feel this is a huge block that is one of the main problems for me i hate being the center of attention as well and i think that i am a very insecure woman now that i am in this relationship the way i think about myself can at times be terrible im great for overthinking and my poor boyfriend gets to deal with it all i know that from a young age because of dad issues or whatever i have abandonment problems and although i think my boyfriend would never and know that he has never done anything behind my back involving another woman i still feel like i will lose him at times and i feel like i am not good enough as you can probably tell i have serious insecurities about myself what i believe are abandonment issues social anxiety a language barrier i am too dependent on him uncomfortable to walk the streets alone a hard time making friends a hard time even going out of my comfort zone sometimes suffer from bouts of depression etc and it is hard on both me and my boyfriend i broke down yesterday because i was holding it all in for so long and i didnt want my boyfriend to know because honestly he is so used to me crying i feel like it doesnt even phase him but he came in the room and i couldnt hide it anymore and he actually cried with me because he couldnt believe how i was feeling about myself etc but today we went to an event and it was so overwhelming for me there was so many people and i started panicking inside and tried to keep it to myself but he sensed it and then as we were leaving i asked if he wanted to get a beer before we went to this other event work and he said no and that we had to go to that event right away but then he saw his friend opened a bar and we went to say hi and the guys completely ignored me and they all talked to eachother in their language and again it hit me and i felt so worthless to be standing there just looking at the ground trying to keep it together and then he asks me if we can have a beer with them and that stung because i just got turned down when i asked we ended up leaving anyway and he noticed i was a little upset and i asked him about the beer thing and the friends who wouldnt even look at me and then he started getting pissed off and he makes this comment why cant we go just one day without it turning bad and i started crying and there was a point i was upset with him and said fuck you and had a short rant and he said you dont even try to get better i dont deserve this i cant even say hi to my friends he totally lost his cool and was yelling and speeding at times and i just kept fucking crying he also asked why for once i cant make it all about me and even though i feel he took things way too far i understand and i feel like a peice of shit and am so upset with myself please why cant i be fucking normal again i feel almost trapped right now but when im good things are amazing but no when he tells me that stuff i just feel like it would be better if i just left for good i am hurting so much please someone help talk to me i have no one to go to and he was the only one i poured my heart and soul to he knows everything about me but when he goes and says this i feel like he just doesnt care and i feel id be better off gone but when i think about it he is my everything he is all i have i am nothing",3

"bike, walk its whenever i look someone in the eye when im on my bike or when im walking somewhere i feel like they look at me and ridicule me in their heads like they judge me even in that split second they see me i know my low confidence is the reason for this but then i start being anxious and self hatred towards myself for being so insecure because im guy years old and have often been told im good looking",3
"walk, outside do i have social anxiety im not sure if i have social anxiety or just am introverted here are some things about me when im walking outside in public without a friend i get self conscious and anxious which causes me to walk faster and take routes with less busy streets my main fear when im in public is that i will meet or be noticed by someone i know causing them to make false assumptions about me depending on my location and situation eg if someone sees me walking in a bad neighborhood im afraid of them assuming im a criminal when i am in public with a friend however its much easier and i get less anxiety i freak out when i am called on by the teacher to read or present in front of the class when my class is taking turns reading out loud i will quickly skim through the paragraph before everyone else to prepare in case i get picked to read next when i present to the class i stutter and cant keep my body still moving my hands excessively walking around etc unless they are my close friends or family i stutter and tend to look down when im having a conversation with another person i get anxiety when making or receiving phone calls when i receive a call i ignore it and later text the person saying that i was busy i reread my emails and make revisions several times before sending them when i want to say something out loud to another person or a group of people i repeat the sentence in my head a few times to make sure the wording doesnt sound wrong i hate standing up in class whether its to go to the restroom or to give something to the teacher when im talking to someone it helps to stand a couple of feet away from them id love to wear a hood and thick clothing to feel secure but i cant due to fear of being judged for what i wear talking and interacting with girls is significantly harder than with guys when my family is going somewhere i make an excuse not to go such as homework i have an unreasonable fear of having bad breath i brush my teeth before i go out to social events always keep sugarfree gum with me and avoid eating sugary food to prevent bad breath i can make myself look confident if i try but its difficult during lunch id rather sit with others than sit alone to avoid looking like i dont have any friends i dont have a license yet but i dont think i would be able to drive at all because of the pressure i could never sit in a plane next to a stranger i was never bullied in my childhood but i had a friend who would make me feel unworthy and less than others i have a loving family and my parents who i look up to are not shy at all i was not like this until i became yo im apologize if this was a long post do i have social phobia or am i just shy please feel free to ask any questions",3

beach duuuude i feel this so hard ive been hoping someone would post about it because im not the best at wording things im an attractive f with pretty bad not horribly bad social anxiety i feel like since im attractive people dont expect me to be so fucking weird youre totally right about the expectations also it sucks when youre good at something and attractive and you wanna do it in public but you feel anxious because people will think youre showing off or something i obviously cant read peoples minds but im pretty sure thats what theyre thinking i love yoga and doing handstands and whatnot but i cant feel comfortable doing it in public by myself like at the beach or something cuz people will start thinking things and i just wanna do it in peaceeeeee agh so ya totally get you and im so glad other people have this problem p,3
backpacking ive been saying this to a few people around here applicable in almost all posts i think i know what you mean this sounds obvious but try to get your anxiety a bit under control one of my ways is to meditate sounds weird i know but it actually helps not after one time but after half a year i really started seeing a difference start tomorrow or tonight half an hour every day youll learn to control your mind i also got away from my group of friends for a while threw myself in the deep by backpacking through another country there is no one to judge you then even a weekend away might help feel free to send a message or reply if you got questions take care,1
"walk, nature do the same i do now take a nice walk in the remote nature or go metal detecting if i didnt have sa i possibly could have a friend or a partner go with me that would be so great in fact to go on a trip with someone is a fantasy of mine",1
"outside, walk yeah totally my neighbors dont like me because sometimes i smoke outside near the apartment i know i shouldnt but anyway they barely look at me i feel insecure about it and tend to look away as well one time i woke up and went outside for a walk i was sober which i rarely am and it made me feel more confident looked my neighbour in the eyes as i passed by him and was still pretty relaxed he greeted me instead of ignoring me id say it truly makes a difference for me",1
"run, park im sorry you feel that way im and ive had social anxiety and bpd since i was around i feel like i completely missed out on uni and now i have a full time job where i cant wait to run home and be alone it makes me really sad and every time i push myself to hang out with people i end up becoming depressed yesterday i pushed myself to go to a house party hour away from home and ended up in the smokers social zone my friend is always super confident and noisy sometimes to a very annoying degree me on the other hand just sat in a corner noded smiled and awkwardly smoked my cigarette i ended up crying to sleep because i felt so pathetic i tell myself today that yesterday was a huge step for me today im challenging myself to go to a park with a friend i havent seen in a while and chat just keep giving yourself small consistent challenges you are not alone",1
walk no need to go gym that makes me nervous walking your dog will work long walks calm me down also,1
run wow exactly like me same age but im male also got bullied in school and literally no one calls me but even so it aint so bad find music you like watch series you want and read books you want without any feedback from the others when you are lonely like me around times in a week i go to run to release some pressure it makes me anxious to run past people so my mind just push me even faster to escape from them i just came to a solution if i cant connect to people i need to fill that loneliness if not im going to get depressed so thats at least one way to make my wellbeing a little better also i cant stand social websites like instagram or facebook because of the photo stuff and the phony people so i just deleted my accounts i dont even have any profile pick in whatsapp just make yourself feel a little better one small step at a time good luck,1
Fresh air its okay sometimes social anxiety is like that the last office party i went to it was hard for me to eat and talk so i totally get it i went outside to get air i went back in and still felt a little odd but the fresh air totally helped if you still feel super uncomfortable just tell them youre not feeling well and go home there will be other parties and sometimes if its too much anxiety its good to take a break,1
walk i think i overwhelmed my therapist but heres the good news its safe to say that social anxiety is only one of my many problems when i told my therapist about my anger isolation and history of drug abuse i saw a look on his face like oh shit this guy is seriously in need of some help theres a plus side to this though im suppose to meet with him again in two weeks in november my goal is to face one fear every single day for two weeks until my next session i started today by walking the campus and meeting a stranger who also told me how lonely they were nothing major happened but i initiated the conversation and broke through the first stage of the anxiety i didnt waste any time making the first movement today im bracing for these next two weeks so i can return to my therapist with news of improvement if youre reading this i know its hard as hell out there when the fear of not facing your fears outweighs the fear itself thats when youll find the motivation to change,1
walk itll pass and get better like it always doesnt with social anxiety but ours brains will probally have to relearn some stuff again i also felt this a bit a few days also when i was getting some icecreams i felt like the shopkeepers were staring at me maybe there were but its ofc never in a malicious way like we think it is but this is somethign thats a basic task and something ive moved past a while ago so i had deffo gone a bit backwards but its ups and downs always so im trying to keep positive at least go out for a walk everyday its allowed and its good for your mind and everyone is out for walks atm as its the only freedom we get during isolation so if u keep doing that a few times youll have to come across people and at least make eye contact and say hello to them so that will make it easier and keep things tying over till we go back to normal,1
runner im a runner and i have to say youre wrong after i run i feel fucking great it doesnt completely cure my social anxiety but i definitely feel euphoric and uplifted,1
"running, run hey man ive been at that point didnt have real man tits but like kg to much im a cm guy and i was really uncomfortable with it struggled with that for years it made me unattractive and other things but i was more afraid of working out in a gym and people seeing how fat i was and how i wouldnt perform the exercises right then of living with it so i did nothing then during my last year of school due to the lack of any social life and stuff i decided i had to do at least something meaningful in my life playing games programming and watching minute physics all day didnt satisfy anymore it didnt serve any purpose then i started running every day in the evening though the fields where no one could see and bother me i think i started with km really slow and i truly hate running and i was really bad at it but at least at the end of the day i had the feeling that id done at least one thing that served a purpose on that day i got better at it started running longer rounds and faster i used one of these running tracking apps they motivate a lot even started to enjoy it sometimes a bit at the same time i started running i cut back my food intake in retrospective i ate way too less then i should have both these things where just hard on a physical level i was a hungry and b running is hard work but youre not working against your fears in that case so its doable fast forward some months later i was still going on a run every day and i partially hated it but i got better i lost weight and for the first time in my life i ran km thinking wow ive never archived that in my life before was a very good receiving and rewarding thought same for and km almost a year later i was down kg at my target still had all my other anxieties and shit but my weight wasnt one anymore since i started college after that i thought why not join a gym i want to build up muscles and from there on i went at least times day and i love it since my weight wasnt an issue before and i had a good friend of mine with me who showed me everything anxiety wasnt an issue there the only thing needed was work and it was sure rewarding i looked better now years later im comfortable with the way i look still have most of my other issues only started working on them recently but seriously weight and muscles are the easiest issues to fix that doesnt make it easy i know ive been there i truly believe you can do that too sorry for the wall of text thought since ive been though a similar thing thing that might help",1
"cabin, cabin, backpacking my old friends planned a trip and didnt invite me on the same weekend as my birthday i years old have some old college friends i still see about every week for various reasons a few of those friends have grown closer to each other and they are closer to each other than they are to me although we still go out for drinks bbq have movie nights and have fun every week or every other week their social networks are also much broader than mine because their careers all require extensive networking i have also made different groups of friends since college but not to the same degree as them i know i feature less prominently in their lives than they do in mine at this point and its not personal we still have a good time and just because things change doesnt invalidate the friendship we do still enjoy and when it comes to planning any kind of party they are definitely my favorite friends to go out for a crazy night or a drink with all of this is fine until it comes to my birthday my birthday falls on labor day weekend last year most of my college friends took advantage of labor day weekend to go on a trip to a cabin and have fun together the person coordinating the event whose parents own the cabin obviously chose who would go only a limited number of people were allowed to come with his parents permission while this same person is a friend of mine i was not a close enough friend to make the cut to be invited on the trip those invited on the trip however included most of my friends from college this forced me to push my birthday party to a different weekend as i still wanted my old college friends at my birthday party i didnt have as many other friends yet that year but it really made me feel pathetic to plan my birthday around people who had decided i was not important enough to include on a trip the same weekend as my birthday from what i understand this same group is going on a trip this labor day weekendonce again on my birthday obviously a lot of people travel on the day weekend and im not a narcissist who expects no one to travel just cause its my birthday i am also mature enough to not be overly offended if some of my friends plan trips without including me sometimes but it really hurts me that my college friends all have a yearly tradition to go on a trip im not invited on every year the same weekend as my birthday i know we all are going our separate ways and i know i am making too much of a deal of my birthday but birthdays are miserable reminders of life passing by for most people after a certain age so i feel extra vulnerable around mine and this is a bit of a punch to the gut for the past years i dont want to be childish and tell them not to use the day weekend that would be dumb and selfish i dont want to force myself onto the trip also dumb and childish and i dont want to cut out friendships over something that i dont think is meant to be personal when these friendships are mostly rewarding throughout the rest of the year if someone could gently help me put this into perspective or how to make me feel less in pain about this however i celebrate on my birthday i know i would feel the absence of those friends and i dont want to plan some elaborate trip in responsethats just petty and wouldnt actually help me stop being petty and hurt over this i was also thinking about going on a backpacking trip alone so i can get some time to myself because i dont like how my relationships with other people are affecting my sense of self worth thats not how i want to live my life and maybe i need to become more independent and i am tired of having all this stress and pageantry around my birthday i just know that i will likely be feeling bad because of this on my birthday i know this is immature and i need to work past this and im afraid this will be in my thoughts no matter what i do please be nice i know i am being needy and vulnerable i want to be better than this so i dont keep beating myself up",1
outside dont be afraid to just up and leave if its not your thing personally i hate clubbing same mediocre music without much variation people being drunk and annoying way to self conscious to dance and let go with friends its sometimes tolerable but then they can pressure you to start dancing and stuff and then i just get ultra defensive and lock up or you can just go outside and have a breather to refresh if you need to,1
walk something that work for me is to expose myself to my anxiety even though im starting to become anxious i keep doing it the trick is to not go over a threshold if im too anxious it affect how i act and then everything goes bad not that bad but my anxiety amplify everything that goes bad and then i keep thinking about it and it just worse taking a walk is a great way you can start in a residential place with less people and then move on to place with more and more going to movie theaters fastfood restaurants conventions also helped me all situations where i had just a little anxiety but that let me see how people acts and let me understands them a little better another thing that you need to do is stopping to be negative about yourself you dont seems to be that negative though you do say anyone who bothers to read this which seems like its negative reading your thread it doesnt bother us we are there to read theses threads like any other one but its important that you are aware that you should avoid negative though often we justify being negative by saying that this way you are aware of your flaw which is better than not sadly often we are wrong theses negatives though arent that important and they are amazing to lose any motivation to improve instead you need to find the positive in the situation and if really theres something negative important dont see it as negative but as something to improve at this point i have no assurances and putting my faith in a psychologist only to go thru months and years of no improvement would probably destroy me it doesnt destroy you right now really how trying anything is worst than not trying anything and staying the mess you are right now believe me you cant be worst than you are right now you can fail and you may fail often but that will just bring you back to where you are right now anxiety is a bitch though and it will always try to give you the impression you dont improve and are just worst than you ever was by simply trying you need to stay positive therapist know what you live they know plenty of ways of dealing with it they are the professional they know what they are doing i never saw one because im sure i can fix that by myself i hate depending on someone but i have no doubt that i would be able to do it much quicker than currently with their help i already convinced myself to go see one if i no longer see improvement,1
outside you have to put yourself out there its easier said than done trust me i know join a club go to the gym get outside more i personally wouldnt try online dating but its an option find someone with similar interests there are millions of women in the world thousands who are completely compatible with you im extremely awkward myself but ive found that life is so much more rewarding when i challenge myself make yourself proud even if the first woman you fall in love with rejects you you should still be proud of yourself life isnt always peaches and rainbows and there will be times when your efforts seem to be in vain but stay strong dont get yourself down pick yourself up youre deserving of love theres someone out there who deserves you just as much as you deserve them you were brave for posting this thats some sort of progress right keep advancing youre doing great,1
"running, nature ive been doing it very gradually for the last few years yoga and meditation really do help by opening up space in the body and breathing consciously it allows more room for different thoughts to come into your mind ive also been doing more long distance running in nature with no music just focusing on my breath and mind has taught me a lot about myself ive also been consciously using weed and psychedelic mushrooms to open up more too but id really recommend getting into a good headspace through yoga and meditation in order to be more receptive to what the plant can teach you i find that as with anything its important to not over indulge in the plant medicines and to allow your body to find its equilibrium sober it helps the lessons sink in more by following my feelings and focusing more on my own interests ive started to feel more comfortable in my own skin and ive been going to events by myself something that was unimaginable a few years back and meeting so many other likeminded beautiful people be kind to yourself it takes patience im slowly starting to reap the benefits of changing my lifestyle",1
park possibly buying something small in a local shop my issues are mostly with crowds and people i dont know very well or sittingreading in a crowded park that is nearby lately ive been trying to compliment people around me and im starting to see some positive results what was the first activity you started with,1
walk i wouldns say ive overcome it completely yet but i do feel much better now compared to how i was a year ago where i barely left my house all by myself i like to think of these things like challengesexperiments for example if youre afraid of walking around the streets by yourself start off by walking around the neighbourhood where you still feel slightly anxious but a lot safer and continue doing that until you feel like theres no threat anymore then go for bigger things if youve got phone anxiety then dial strangers on purpose and act stupid then say youve got the wrong number and hang up if wanna talk freely to a group of around people for example try expressing yourself when theres only people for example you know baby steps i also tried to neutralize my anxious thoughts if an anxious thought would suddenly occur about an upcoming event i would try to calm myself down and say something like maybe it wont be as bad as i think maybe ill do better this time it cant be that bad ive done this before and i know ill do it again i certainly wont die mantras such as i am completely independent of the good and bad opinions of the others in my opinion also help haters gonna hate i can only be myself and if someone doesnt like me for it then its their problem not mine i am just as important as anyone else is etc sometimes if i fail and end up being awkward or anxious i just try to pick myself up dust myself off and congratulate myself for at least trying telling myself that maybe next time ill do better because i know that as long as i keep trying and moving on and some day when that last restriction of my life melts away i will finally reach my goal where ill be happy anxiety free and live the life ive always wanted ps i also meditate daily to keep a clear mind i personally think it helps us to reinforce the positive statements i mentioned above more easily into our minds apologies for the crappy english,1
"jogs, walk its okay at least you know that your perception of love is not realistic loneliness will never really go away despite getting a significant other unless you get to a point where you are content with yourself at the very least reduce your drinking smoke less drink more water and go for jogswalks more often if you keep this up it will be substantially beneficial man the only way you can fully get on the path towards progress is to forgive yourself be selfcompassionate its alright to make mistakes as long as we use them as stepping stones continue writing you dont have to be nabakov or charles dickens to start let yourself take baby steps instead of expecting full recovery of yourself in an instant one thing i kind of did with social anxiety and depression was go fuck it why do i care about this why do i overthink the world will eventually end and nothing will matter none of these people are anything in the grand scheme of things i am nothing as well thus i have nothing to lose and im free to just do whatever i want without this fear i have the right to in this short life im just going to live the best i can i deserve that no time is really wasted its all how you look at things",1
"walk, outside, outdoors, park go out for a walk once a day additionally and slowly start increasing the time you spend outside try to go a different route everytime if its not causing too much stress if you live in a bigger town or city go shopping instead of online shopping call some businesses and just ask random questions about their product start to go to a bar at first during the week later on weekends too you dont have to talk to people just drink one drink and then go home after half an hour start doing sport either outdoors or at a gym if you trust her talk to your friend about your problems if you can try to take your dog to a dog park or something like that try to make smalltalk with the other dog owners these are just some ideas but please take it slow and dont overburden yourself the key is to slowly expand your comfort zone and your optimal performance zone without going into the danger zone ideally you would do this under supervision from a professional like a therapist if the topic is interessting to you search for exposure therapy hope i could help",1
"hiking, running yes but those thoughts have been getting better recently you can be alone and still be happy for me personally i love hiking reading running etc it doesnt matter if i do all of those things alone they make me happy and im happy doing them find a hobby you can enjoy and then enjoy it no matter who joins you ironically dedicating myself to personal hobbies has made it slightly easier to talk to people if anyone ever asks about me i can talk about my hobbies talking about hobbies seems to be way easier than discussing my personal or professional life which kind of suck",1
"outside, walk, running one thing that really helped me just get outside and around people was going on walksrunning around a trail it was terrifying the first few times but then i realized that no one really cared that i was there its an easier and understandably challenging thing to start doing if youre uncomfortable being around people even when theres no need to talk i tend to get anxious whenever people can see me i enjoyed trails with a lot of turns so i wasnt constantly in sight of people but once i got used to it i had to force myself a few times i went to different trails that had a more straight path for a change of scenery its something ive done for about a year and a half now that i really enjoy doing multiple times a week sorry for any errors i dont really comment things",1
Garden im near your age and have had two jobs thus far my social anxiety is very crippling but i realize i need money to make my life better in the long run ie college funds rent etc so here are some personal tips nn volunteer local pet shelters are great for this as they accept everyone who is willing and not a crazy psycho trying to skin cats this will introduce you to the social environment of work and if you volunteer at a pet shelter you will have animals to calm you during the stressful moments plus you can literally decide to go whenever you want for me i go once a week for an hour or two and i even lead shifts now it helpsnn apply for quiet places like a fabrics store or garden center something very mello will help your anxiety my first job was at walmart in the produce section the worst youll have to deal with is someone asking you where the oranges are while standing in front of them you dont have to work at mcdonalds boo you can be a recluse and water plants for hours a daynn you have phone anxiety like me so dont pick up let them leave a voicemail i got so many calls when applying for my first jobs and never once answered the first time they would leave a voicemail and i would promptly call back within hours to a day and give some believable excuse as to why i couldnt answer such as i was in school on the road personal issue bad cell service etc theyd always be happy to hear back and i would schedule interviews that way once you have an interview save their number and wait for a call back and pick up if you can that timenn practice practice practice write down possible questions and answers to them go over them outloud take phone calls in a quiet or calm place practice common interview questions and prepare to be nervousnn set your hours low at first and work later or in the mornings go for about to a week and work from there do not i repeat dont set hours youll hate out of desperation that they will only want you if your availability is from am to pm monday to sunday also pick late or early shifts ie pick shifts after people go to work for the day to before they get off am to pm or after they are usually at home or asleep pm to early am for me personally this is a great time to work at a store like walmart target etc the most customers youll face are nurses or old women who are looking for plants in the meat asile get to know your citys schedule and schedule yourself for times when the mass of people are typically busy or elsewhere hour stores are usually in need of people for these shiftsnn finally tell them you have anxiety i have had two jobs but have been offered over five and have applied to about places all of which if i was interviewed i explained my social anxiety employers nowadays are a bit more sensitive to this you can say i have very bad social anxiety and would prefer doing things mostly in the back or away from people until i am used to the work environment to prevent any problems from arising theyll usually say well we will train you to do x thing but if it takes some time well work with you thats when you know theyre interested dont hide your anxiety to someone who can affect your future employability my current boss and assistant manager both know how bad i suffer and often coddle me when they see it affecting my work performance my fellow employees though i am not friends with them also understand this and will help me i work in a pizza place and i take orders on register give out food and answer phones when i need to step away i ask someone to take over and they will getting overwhelmed isnt bad just take a second to step backnnsome other general tips to remember always apply for jobs youll like first wait a few days and then apply for jobs you can deal with theoretically try to really go for jobs that match your interests as itll be easier to adjust tonnif you get denied dont freak i did this before and it does nothing but take away all your hard work an interview will happen againnni hope i helped,1
"outside, walk first day going to the gym i guess this is kind of a success ive suffered from social anxiety for many years and as a result have pretty much just hidden away at home this has made my social skills even worse to the point that i even struggle with being around family members and no longer have any friends that i can see in person im a year old guy with no work experience and very little life skills this needs to change so this last month ive been making more of an effort to improve things and hopefully this is the start of me becoming more socially comfortable i recently started seeing a support worker and shes helped me with going outside more together weve been exploring my local area and im getting used to walking around and just generally being outside this has all lead up to why im making this post today i recently joined a gym surprised myself ive always wanted to improve my fitness but lack the motivation and initiative to do it at home this is why i figured joining a gym would make sense because it would also force me to go out more regularly its almost am and i have an introductory meeting at the gym at pm im feeling pretty nervous and im very tempted to avoid it today is the first day and hopefully not the last wish me luck fellow redditors",1
"outside, walk, park definatley social anxiety bro best advice i could give is to start using your mic in video games to talk to people build up your social skills with random people in video games and once youve developed your social skills enough to where youre confident then go outside more go on a walk in the park go to the library or find something else to do youre bound to strike up converstation with random people maybe not straight away but eventually you will best of luck",1

running yeah my anxiety can be really exacerbated by weed ive found that if i have some and do yoga or exercise i go deeper into my practice and its really beneficial but if i just sit and watch tv whilst im high it makes the anxiety so bad ive had some pretty bad panic attacks whilst high i occasionally do guided meditations but mostly i just do yoga and running has become a moving meditation practice for me i also put hz and frequency music on and just sit with myself and its amazing what can come up theres lots of different methods of meditation i guess its just about finding a form that resonates with you the most,1

"nature, walk some sort of weekly class im not sure about yours but my local community centres offer tons of them art classes dance classes yoga pilates weightlifting music i started taking weekly ballet classes in an attempt to start getting out there it was terrifying at first but i quickly got used to it and actually took various other classes it gave me a lot of confidence i think the weekly classes are nice because you sort of know what to expect week after week you grow comfortable with the people in your classes which makes it easier to get to know them as opposed to seeing a group of different people every class and the routine of it is also very nice its easier to convince yourself to go knowing that its just part of your weekly routine ive also started volunteering once a week for a few hours at an animal rescue i work on my own for the most part but talk to the other volunteers occasionally thats kind of the nature of my volunteer work but you could volunteer with a food bank or boys and girls club which would involve more social interaction youre getting out there and making a difference generally i think getting out of the house and doing anything is progress whether youre interacting with other people or not because im not sure about you or anyone else but when my social anxiety is bad i retreat into myself and stay home where im comfortable just breaking that cycle by going for a short walk around the neighbourhood is a good idea you could smile and say hello to people as you walk by which may or may not be difficult for you or practice mindfulness",1
running im not joking but i would say cold showers push ups go running get moving your body shock your system with something positive eg cold water you obviously want to live on some level so remind yourself why it is remind yourself you have a heart blood pumping in your veins and you are alive right now it sounds like you are in a dark pit at the moment and ive been in one too for many years but the way out of that pit isnt by talking to people on the internet im not being harsh im being serious butnothing will change until u change the messages you are telling yourself i cant be fixed nothing positive is realetc if thats your belief then thats gonna be your reality change your thoughts and you watch how quick your external reality changes thats some fucking cosmic alchemy shit right there son,1
walk im too i went through a month period where i didnt leave the house at all and when i did it was in the early am or late pm to goto the grocery store the best advice i can give is take it in baby steps first just try and take a quick minute walk to the end of your street and back once youre comfortable with that make it a little longer maybe walk to a nearby shop without necessarily going inside until you feel comfortable,1
hikes it sucks to lose friends sometimes life happens and friends grow apart and its really sad sometimes its a good thing to lose friends like your jerk friend who called you a bitch but let me tell you friends are overrated recently i started doing things by myself like going on hikes to movies restaurants etc and ive never had so much fun i find that some activities can only be truly enjoyed alone especially when i have social anxiety,1
run why do i have no social anxiety at all after a min run hey guys quick question ive recently discovered that if i run before a social event im the most confident person ever especially with a beta blocker but in the morning before exercise i get watery eyes in public feel hollow and struggle to keep eye contact without crying whats going on,1
outside barely any people outside when its dark so its awesome and rain is the most soothing feel,1
"outside, bike, sun totally worth it man not even a question its hard to tell you what to do but what i will say is to definitely dont think about it its quite a challenge but the reward of being being totally cool and calm when youre there outweighs the effort of the next few weeks heres the part where i mention all the things you could be doing to ease your mind read go outside exercise and weve all heard this spiel and know how great they all arebut they are great in fact probably the greatest things you can do during these next two weeks and why not really reading will occupy your mind while keeping you focused even entertained and going for a bike ride on a nice day feels so good in the sun trust me man change your life for a bit see what its like to be where you want to be im putting in more effort in myself and its been great you dont really get used to it everyday being a new normal then what it used to be is progress",1
"walk, park you are probably very young and exaggerating some of your fears which are normal in the adolesence i do not think you have agoraphobia otherwise you probably would not even be in school assuming thats the place you are afraid of i understand the incompatibility that you percieve but do not entretain this thought as it is provocating a lot of social anxiety after all remember that she was the one who reached out to you and have nothing to lose if it doesnt work out all you gain is experience with girls if the presence of your classmates in this relation is causing so much anxiety as she knows everyone and would drag attention mabey try asking her out to something simple a walk to a park or just a nearby coffee shop its a hard terrifying jump of a cliff but i think if you manage to talk to her in a safer enviroment other than school without gossip your nerves could calmn down",1
"running, run, horse, walk i so agree its such a feel good thing for me i use to go running at this track in the field of a school early in the morning like but now that school has started not only cant i run there but theres like the fear of morning hustle and bustle of parents dropping off kids no matter where i run running in the daytime is just the worst so many people also to make it worse i run really fast which i feel draws a lot of attention to me and this is weird but its almost hard for me to slow down i feel like im galloping like a horse or something i even walk way faster then normal",1
beach i do crafts like scrapbooking painting decorating right now im redecorating my desk area with a beach theme because the beach is my favorite place its so calming and reminds me of my most fun childhood moments,1

"park, walk hate to tell you what you already know but trial and error is the best way exposure therapy something that i first did when i started to try and improve my sa was to go to my local park and just go for walks i made it a point to smile and nod to everyone i passed and eventually gave a verbal hi there or hey i wont forget how hard that was at the time and how far ive come because of those days so bars and clubs dont really vibe with you they arent my thing either unless someone invites me but there are other outlets if you have a local card shop or board game shop i would bet they have weekly gatherings and play mtg or monopoly these kinds of places tend to attract a crowd of people with sa and as im sure you can guess they are very welcoming people i also spend a lot of time with my sisters i can honestly call them my best friends they have helped me tremendously with my sa ive got a long ways to go like yourself ive never been in a relationship i try not to let that get me down though its a daily struggle but i try hard to have a positive outlook and im very proud of that i would say your best bet to developing friendships is to find them within your work its tough i know god do i know but more often than not if youre kind to people and have a genuine interest in what they say and who they are you will naturally fall into a routine with them who knows maybe they will invite you out somewhere",1
"skate, skating edit midway through typing i literally just noticed that you asked if anyone has never had a bfgf and not if youve ever but ive been typing this for too long to delete it all so sorry im not meaning to rub it in anyones face im just sharing my experience andxb im and have had girlfriends technically but only really count one in middle school was my first relationship with this girl named c it started when i asked her to a dance which was extremely nerve racking and that was before my sa got too bad it was a pretty standard relationship we held hands and hung out then we broke up like weeks later then at the end of th grade i started dating a girl named m we kinda dropped hints that we liked each other but never did anything about it a few weeks into summer i mustered up the courage and sent her a long heartfelt text about how i really liked her and whatnot i wasnt really asking her out but just making my feelings clear then like a week later she asked me out and i said yes i think we hung out once during our relationship then she dumped me about weeks in with the classic its not you its me excuse fast forward years to the end of summer before th grade starts this girl named d that i kinda knew from school replies to a photo of my dog on ig and we start talking i really like skateboarding and post a lot of videos of me skating and she complemented me on those i told her that i could teach her if she wanted and after a little convincing we decided to meet initially i was really nervous about meeting her when i offered to teach her how to skate i was just being friendly in hopes i might make a new friend to skate with however she dropped some hints that she liked me which instantly made me x more nervous to meet her i made one of my friends come along because i know hes goofy and would take attention off me if i needed anyways the meeting went well and d and i continued to talk and become more friendly after awhile we both know that we like each other and are basically bf and gf for some reason d had this idea that someone had to explicitly ask the other person out for it to be a couple she told me she wanted me to ask her out and i said that its silly to ask someone to ask you out if you both want to date each other and both know that you want to date each other then youre basically bf and gf no need for someone to ask the other out anyways she then asks me out a few weeks later and so i guess thats technically the started of our relationship but its whatever i think we dated for around months d was the first girl that i ever truly felt like i loved i genuinely felt like i would do anything for her and that i wanted to be with her forever then what felt like out of nowhere she tells me shes not happy and wants me to do more for her she wants me to know what she wants without her telling me i tell her ill try my best and we continue dating a week later she dumps me because she just doesnt like me anymore for a few days i was extremely depressed i sit through school feeling numb then id come home and lie in bed watching youtube until it was time to fall asleep i was even somewhat suicidal at some point she also got mad at me because one of her guy friends threatened to beat the shit out of me if i talked to her and i basically called him a retarded and messed with him a little apparently in her mind me messing with her friend was worse than him threatening to beat me up and so she stopped talking to me as well at that point i wasnt as depressed but i was still sad but about a day after she stopped talking to me i suddenly realized that i didnt need her after i realized that i instantly became happier i stopped caring about her and started caring about myself i started skating more often and talking to friends its been about a month since we broke up and im feeling better than ever just remember anons you dont need a girl or boy to be happy do things that you enjoy find a hobby meet new friends theres so much to do in the world dont be down just because you havent met that special somone yet",1

run im and i think my social anxiety is gone but i believe it has caused some other issues well im currently in my second semester of college and everything is online im also working parttime at my third job a walmart stocker and well i have been surprised that i have been able to talk to my coworkers and customers with no problems at all really no social anxiety now its probably due to wearing a mask like when i had sunglasses on during my summer jobs however i still have general anxiety about being rushed to finish things and thats making me feel horrible exhausted and so stressed out highschool is when it all started my social anxiety before then i always been an introvert who barely talked shy and had nothing really to say when i did speak often times i had to repeat it since no one could hear me im just naturally soft spoken i guess my two older siblings have anxiety too sorry about how i am texting im tired and having trouble putting this together uh highschool took a toll on me and it was draining symptoms that i remember erythrophobia serve trembling jerking and shaking in my neck head hands shoulders and torso feeling like i cant speak because my voice would be all shakey sweating excessively overthinking tearful eyes and fast heartbeat all of this made me the popular loner everyone liked me but i never talked much i did have a few groups of friends that made life easier though i was that person who was terrified to be alone at lunch im too and i felt like i stuck out too reading became my habit because it was an excuse to not having to do social activities all of this made me go to sleep wanting to well die kind of embarrassing to say this but i usually fantasize myself dying before going to sleep and it helps me fall asleep its like how i say im going to quit my job which makes me able to get through the day i dreaded school just like i do with work but for stress and well yeah i dont know if i still have social anxiety i mean yes i never turn my camera on in school but i have no problems at work i dont like speaking but i can speak not without a shakey voice i gotten used to my heigh and i dont shake as much as i used too did i finally after years of fighting it win im not smart honestly to never seek help i do regard myself poorly i dont think im intelligent smart enough to succeed in this world i dont like myself how i look the way i act think and how i cant maintain conversations since its boring or how i dont want to talk like at all perhaps im in denial about being depressed i probably should quit my job too and idk try to tackle it on my own again however i had the whole beginning of covid to do so but i just wasted time im scared to seek help because its going to be embarrassing and really i have memory problems and well i feel like im going to forget what to say this is why i just keep ignoring everything laying in bed all day or sitting on the couch watching youtube or tiktoks my life before covid is the same as now i run miles daily thats the only thing good with my life im sorry if this isnt the right place to say all of this i just thought people might be able to understand me,1
running easier said than done for me personally not running gives me far more anxiety,1
lake m i somehow got girls snaps today so today i went to a lake with some of my cousins and saw a girl i thought was cute playing volleyball so i went over with my cousin that is my age and asked to play with them they said yes so we played a little bit i was terrible mind you i was terrified the entire time just able to hide it anyways we it was time to go and so i asked for her snap and boom later that day we went to this local fair and me and this girl had been making eye contact pretty often i thought nothing of it and went on with my day later on i saw her again we made eye contact and i smiled so suddenly she comes up to me and asks for my snap even better my uncle tells me a girl came up to him and asked about me this story is so mind bogglingly different than the rest of my life it feels like a dream or something goodnight reddit,1
outside yeah as a side note dont tell your kid theyre being rude by being quiet either my family are amazing selfless people of the time but there was one day in my teens now when i felt quite uncomfortable because there were a fair few other people in the house and i made a point of going outside with my sister instead where it was less overwhelming i was later told by a rather irritated family member how rude i was being by staying out of the way it was pure lack of understanding on her part she and everyoneelse are much more aware of my sa now but it really hurt me at the time because there was nothing i could do to change how i felt around others and the comment stuck with me in some ways it made me even more hyperaware of how other people are perceiving me because i dont want them to think im rude and its always in the back of my mind,1
"beach,  walk, beach alone but not lonely does anyone else take walks alone and feel okay about it im currently alone right now at the beach after taking a long walk im really anxious when i go out especially at a busy place like the beach but strangely enough i rather walk alone than with company and it feels okay",1
nature maybe try to find a hobby i bought a second hand d printer and have loads of things to do with it picking up metal detecting got me to go out in the nature at least once a week exposure to sunlight increases serotonine levels hobbies can fill a part of the void pretty well its not a perfect substitute by any means but i found it helped break the weedtvdepression habit im still really lonely and failling at life but my hobbies offer me a glimpse of hope i still enjoy the things youve listed from time to time but its not an addiction imo and i try to avoid spending too much time that way,1
Go for a walk put away your notes and make up and try to turn off your mind for a bit honestly no thinking about what to say no thinking at all it helps to sit in a chair close your eyes and focus on your breathing so that it can slow down then move your focus from your feet to your legs to your back all the way to your head and try to really feel the way your feet are in your shoes touching the floor how the back of your thighs is touching the chair et cetera its a form of mindfulnessnndo this for some time lets say minutes do your make up then get out of that hotel room and take your notes with you go for a walk try to focus on your senses the smells the sounds the winds and the temperature possible the sun burning your skin nnmaybe read your notes slightly while you walk it offers you a chance to still read it but focus your attention on something else at the same time i hope this helps good luck and even if something that you anticipated happened it is nt a bad thing and nt the end of the world its just a moment minute maximum it will pass,1
parkour link from another post i madei feel as if i would get some enjoyment from socializing it would help lift my mood make me animated and not so robotic it would also allow me to do more hobbies that could be more social based or public like parkour freerunning tricking bboying popping and other kinetic ways of expression i would get to go to where all the artists are and interact with them exposure to that world being with like minded people etc i am having difficulty articulating this but ultimately it would breath in life i feel so empty right now,1
"outside, jog, run you and me were at the same place years barely any real life experience sick of studying to work when we cant even find ways to enjoy free time outside of it we fucking need to do something completely different i have been contemplating ever since the last semester started of dropping out and then doing something drastic thats totally outside of what i have done before i grow too apathetic and careless in this state i should travel or something and get to see life more so i dont feel so detached i thought moving out would be the start of me forcing myself to having to go out more but its the opposite i have the extra stress of having to take care of myself but now i can fully isolate and not seek out people every day and i dont have parents or siblings that get guests or even people i get to talk to last weekend i spoke to nobody for days straight and now im derealized again im also depressed again and it makes me work slow and get behind in my studies and i dont even like playing video games anymore because everything bores me to death im sure its just another episode of us being depressed op and then perhaps in a week well have a couple of good days again i used to jog once a week in the summer leading up to semester start but its getting colder outside and im more exhausted and dont get as many things done but i think we really need something to revitalize us also i envy you for actually having a place with girls i study in a small town because its the only place in my country with the special education found there but theres only like girls there normally i dont have a chance at flirting to begin with because im so awkward and anxious but now theres not even any girls that stick out that i can daydream about it sucks and im just tired as shit of living here anyway were practically venting the both of us but hang in there and make the best of tomorrow let the depression run its course until youre reminded of something positive you can do peace",1
"walk, outside i used to have anxiety exactly like yours i was really pathetic tho couldnt talk to anyone without being terrified and panicking i would constantly scream at myself inside my head i hated myself and i couldnt stop thinking everyone hated me and i was weird even tho no one was like that to me and when i got social anxiety years ago in school when it started i would sit away from my friends which i normally say next to and they would ask me what im doing and tell me to come back i could barely speak to people and social anxiety literally ruined my life i went from being friends with loads of people and being out going to being pathetic and distancing my self away from everyon except a few close friends telling my self over and over how much they hate me and think im weird getting the bus to school was a nightmare for me every night i would get like hours of sleep except for weekends and i would do an allnighter every sunday night which made getting out of bed and getting on the bus where i just panicked and was terrified everyone was staring at me and thinks im weird and i would never talk to anyone unless they talked to me and i would also see my mates in form room or on the bus and sit on my own and then get shouted to it with them or they would come sit with me social anxiety ruined my life i went from being happy confident and friends with everyone to planning on killing myself everysingle day thinking about dying was the only thing that i would think about and it was the only thing that put me at ease knowing that i wouldnt have to suffer for much longer the anxiety never went away for years i had it in school and it just got worse and worse not even being able to walk past people without feeling horrible and terrified feeling like you cant walk or look properly when i left school i used to think my anxiety was getting better but i was just fooling myself cause i never left my house i never got anxious but when i started working and going out with friends i realized how wrong i was as i went outside and actually seen people i cant go in shops without freaking out or walk around outside where people are it is so horrible that i hate leaving my house and i realized that my anxiety never got better that i just have less confrontation as in school it was constantly seeing people but the thing i hated worst was not being able to speak in school i could only speak to people if i was on my own with them if anyone said hi to me i just couldnt speak to them my voice would go super quiet and sound weird and i just couldnt say anything but i feel like my anxiety has got better at the moment but i feel like the anxiety has just left emotional scars on me and now im never gonna be able to fully recover and will always be fucked from it",1
park same here i feel really awkward eating around people at my college so i always go to a park thats not exactly that close,1
"running, run i feel like this a lot of the time too but ive noticed it helps when i focus on improvable skills i beat myself up about not being charismatic enough or smart enough but you know what i can improve on running painting writing piano etc it has been sooo good for my self esteem to focus on activities like these its like that cliche saying about only focusing on being better than you were yesterday except its sorta true lol its certainly not something that comes naturally but when you start setting goals and meeting them its incredibly rewarding and wholesome ive never felt particularly good at anything either but now i can say that i run and thats better than nothing",1
"walk, park ill try to give some advice but take it as you will im pretty much at rock bottom that being said here i go this is how i try to think about it i know my weaknesses and strengths eg im good at staying at my house all day isolating myself in my room im bad at my social skills whether its small talk asking for directions making friends ect ill myself am going to make a list of things on a spectrum via whats the easiest and whats the worst worsttalking to a random girl on the street vs easymaybe walking into the bookstore to check out the newest book selection once you figure out the problems its much easier to dissect how to fix it and since im bad at everything ill have to learn from the bottom idk if this is a real quote but everything in life is a skill all you need is determination and practice to become a master for whatever circumstances we didnt master socializing as children which is suppose to happen socializing is a skill this is why its called social skills same with any sport or even humor great ted talk about this topic now since you know the solution which is repeated exposure or practice this can be pretty tricky because you anxiety will do everything in its path to say go back to your comfort zone idk where im going with this i was trying to end on a good note but i guess i would try to study your sa or whatever is causing these bad feelings since im a hermit im going to buy tons of selfimprovement and social skills books and read on how to keep on conversation going be interesting those sort of things then im going to go out and experiment even if my anxiety says no of course ill start slow like maybe first ill walk down a park then ill gradually gain the confidence to look someone in the eye lastly i might smile and greet them while passing by baby steps also documenting in a journal helps",1

Go for a walk well im going to start finding some new hobbies im also going to volunteer at my local shelter to care for the doggies i dont know how its going to work out yet but i think just getting out there is the best thing you can do nnyou can start small too go for a walk in your neighborhood then a local park just keep upgrading look for meetups in your area and just go go to a concert,1
"walk, outside that i have no problem with at all in passing or if i am interacting with them when walking down the street for example lately ive been trying to walk with my head up make eye contact and smile at most females who walk by me although sometimes theyll sometimes look at me then look away real quick or just look at me and look down sometimes in my head i feel like i am being a creep by looking and smiling at them when i walk by but i need to get rid of that mindset in work i always make eye contact and smile but when i start interacting with them the anxiety hits my like a brick wall and then ill usually look away id love to at least start taking it to another step maybe just say something in passing say something to them as i am standing by them waiting to cross the street waiting in line waiting outside etc etc but i am not sure where to start what do you suggest any tips or advice",1
running second this running or whatever physical activity you like really helps me put things in perspective i think being around people which makes the anxiety go crazy really messes with my priorities i truly dont want to care what others think just what i think of myself and when im around people and so self conscious i become someone that molds herself to what others needwant which i dont like running really helps me reset this mindset after being around people for long time,1

outside i feel for you i dont have many friends anymore either and havent found friends where i moved for college i always tell myself i will try to change it im in therapy and everything but you cant force people to like you but you also cant give up when things dont go as planned so i will try again after the summer find a new hobby or look into volunteering the more youre outside around people the less anxiety you will feel,1

"running, run i was in the exact same situation in between my undergrad and masters there were a lot of little things that helped me in the end i got my mom to help force me to apply to stuff making a deadline with someone helped to motivate me to finally do stuff honestly this was the trigger that got me started applying get your boyfriend or someone else you trust to help you make those calls even if its just them sitting beside you while you do it i know that this in itself can be stressful mindfulness meditation has helped me mindfulness is the psychological process of purposely bringing ones attention to experiences occurring in the present moment without judgment basically practice feeling your emotions without judgement just let them flow through accept them let them be and finally understand that they dont have to control you honestly pretty difficult to be completely mindful but the idea and a little bit of practice has helped me out i would recommend looking up mindfulness on a few websites and see where it goes i set up a time every day where i would go and focus on applying writing cvs emailing people etc it usually only ended up being like hours a day but that was enough to get some stuff done i went running every day you dont have to run but i would suggest finding a little hobby that can keep you happy counseling has never really helped me but it has helped other people could always give it a shot",1

"running, outside i literally feel the same way and the thing is lately ive been running outside and it feels great but im missing out on weights in my routine because i hate going to the gym my gym a few months ago wasnt that bad but as summer comes around and more people signed up after it opened up its been so busy when i go in i start working out just in my own corner and i dont mind when there are people its more like when someone gets on a machine next to me i start to panic and its horrible i usually finish but my thoughts race when that happens it sucks but you arent alone",1
walk its true for me i realized it more and more into my university life especially as classes became more demanding and i had to rely on other people of my classes have been teambased and i mean compulsory team projectspresentations which means that i cant just study my ass off alone in my house anymore trying to be part of a team is constantly putting stress on me presentations are a nightmare i struggled during my internship because of my bad social skills but i managed i study computer engineering and i thought i could be a genius programmer and code all day every day but no no matter what your job is social skills are a must im not saying this to scare you but its what ive learned even in the college world i see many people who pass because they hang out with the best students they share the best notes get familiar with professors etc and i dont accomplish as much with sheer work and dedication during this time i have managed through difficult situations i have somehow improved my social skills but i still struggle every single day if i were you i would start by trying to connect with fellow students its not about having friends its about securing your network in case you need to work with others in the future try to find some people that you see often and maybe sit next to them in class you can do some small talk by asking them if they know how x thing is solved or something i believe that going out of the house is beneficial even if you dont have a purpose just go on a walk to relax there are periods when i get stuck at home for many days in a row and my sa deteriorates significantly dont isolate yourself just try to push yourself little by little also theres no need to ever compare yourself with others you do whats best for you and let others do their thing,1
"running, walk i hear ya man i turn almost this year and have social anxiety pretty badly i can say it is not as severe as having to drop out of school but it was pretty close to it a few things i can tell you mindfulness something i should practice more of but mindfulness is a form of meditation to help bring your mind out of the constant state of thinking ie about if others are judging me and brings you to a complete focused state look up mindfulness audio sessions or something like that on google there is plenty of tutorials and things to help dont break the chain its something the famous comedian jerry sienfeld talked about this is a comedian who has done so many stand up routines that it seemed so unlikely he was able to write that many jokes how does he do so many one hour specials he mentioned it was something he calls dont break the chain or in other words he would write a joke every single day good or not but do so every single day the reason i say this is because you should find something to work on every single day no matter what i myself joined a gym about a year and a half ago it was not because i wanted to lose weight though that was on my mind as well but because i needed some constant factor in my life that i would put forth effort each day to complete something i had to do to keep my mind on it you should find something to do even if its just drawing a small picture or running a mile do it every day and if for whatever reason you cant just do it the next day in all of my years in dealing with social anxiety and a negative family putting me down i realize that the anxiety stems mostly from overthinking is that person looking at me from their car as i walk down the street am i worthless because i dont have a job is what im wearing okay etc the list is endless for me social anxiety has stopped me from my potential being fully realized it has stopped me from having a healthy relationship with pretty much any woman it has stopped me from going out on the few beautiful days i see here i still have it but not as bad i practice a few things every day and you eventually reach a point of self confidence you will know when you start to get comfortable with yourself and you start having thoughts like who gives a shit what they think this is what im doing for me one last note i currently live in an area where cannabis is legal for recreational use i started smoking not for my social anxiety itself but the fact that many other people here seemed to do it i started smoking to make friends but now i keep smoking because it does make me feel good and content with the world around me not saying you should smoke pot but it is something that has helped me very greatly hopefully i was of some help either way the best of luck to you",1
walk grounding and breathing techniques work for some some people prefer listening to music taking a walk or a bath etc doing an activity that you enjoy can sometimes take your mind of your worries but i personally understand that thoughts can get overwhelming no matter what youre doing working bit by bit to relax will help you master the ability in my experience as an anxious person i couldnt just get relaxed immediately its taking time to find out what works by trying a few things maybe make a list of what you like to do or google relaxation techniques and try some note the way it makes you feel and try to implement some techniques in your daily schedule,1
"jogs, walk like the other guygirl said its mostly diet cut back on carbs and sugar and try to totally eliminate sugary drinks dairy can help a lot too and for the boost and help that exercise makes go for jogs at night assuming you live in a safe area thats what i do between am and am nobody is ever out cars might drive by but at that time they are usually too busy thinking i fucking hate my life for being out this late im so tired that they wont pay attention to you in my months of walking at night ive never seen someone even look at me from their car or you can work out in your house while you watch tv",1
"walk, park yeah and i know how hard it is but just try it walking in a park is something normal a lot of people do it for various reasons i personaly do it because its good for my back without walk my back hurts from being to much seated everyday so go there and good luck",1
hiking im a girl and i struggle with this as well with guys i just want to tell you that your image matters having unique style good photos of yourself smiling helps im pretty unapproachable as a girl because of my anxiety if you look unhappy as a guy it can be a lot worse because women are taught to be weary of men who seem emotionally unstable like anger issues etc if you have rbf thats going to work against you massively it might help to take up some feminine hobbies like knitting yoga dance meditation a nice neutral hobby along with a more outgoing sport hiking football etc this allows you to be in a space that can actually be helpful for your anxiety along with interacting with women start trying to build friendships with women first dont go into relationships thinking they will be romantic that will take a lot of pressure off of you also dont refer to women as females as a start humanize us as much as possible educate yourself about women issues but remain a listener in those spaces i have yet to have luck with making guy friends mostly because a lot of things guys find interesting sports cars video games smoking and drugs i find boring and ive found that a lot of men ive talked to simply arent interested in what i like and are less inclined to learn about what i like im willing to learn about a sport a guy really likes but i tend to sense they really arent interested in my own interests i think a lot of women feel this way they are expected to change their interests in relationships to suit their partner not good for either sex its good to find common ground or start something new together women are less likely to approach men if you arent approaching us and we have to talk to you its likely the girls you think dont like you actually are reading you as being uninterested,1
"outside, runs it is like before i was already very homey i liked to be at home and i thought this job would be perfect for me i think it is in many ways but i just dread my script and dread being repetitive it makes me wanna jump out the window its stressful i do try to get out a lot because of this especially now that its nicer outside i go for runs every day almost but this last week like something threw me off i cant pinpoint it i need to just face it and either find a new job or like the other comment says like try to be more present its hard when my anxiety takes over though",1
nature if you have any access to counseling or a loved one who would listen i dont i dont know if it would help but it helps me to seek out nature when i feel hopeless and useless it takes me out of my head to watch animals and plants even if you were homeless youd still be you and that is beautiful youre strong because of the life the universe has given you and they way your mind works i know you can persevere through this id be me for about hours until i decide to end myself,1
"walk, outside after i havent left the house for a while or even days it feels scarier to leave the house again but despite that after i go out i get use to it and realize its not so bad maybe start small like walking to the mailbox sitting outside your house taking a short walk then start doing bigger things",1
"run, outside, biking, running, hiking tdlr i have job one close friend a girlfriend place of my own am able to run outside and am able to shop without any worry what so ever a couple years ago i had none of that and was too afraid to pursue any of it im if you continually push yourself and try out new techniques and starters you will improve improvement is slow i first pushed myself when i started getting outside and going biking in public about years ago then i floundered and didnt do anything for a good year then i started running then i didnt push myself for another of a year give or take finally about years ago i started pushing myself a lot more everyday i started writing resumes for jobs i made a goal of going hiking and saying hi to every stranger that i passed i went to fast food places on a whim just to practice after a few months i got a job i then got busy with that and didnt do much for a while then i finally got the courage to try dating and found a girlfriend after a few months process was really slow with a lot of lull periods typically i would be really motivated for a week and try something new and then be demotivated for a couple and stop honestly still working on getting over those demotivated stages i still get anxious over some things i still overthink hair cuts i still have trouble speaking up in groups but overall i am so much happier and have made a lot of progress",1
running porn causes social anxiety and depression you should join the nofap community here on reddit its really good with a lot of good insight and encouragement a lot of people on there are having the same problems you are change your diet to a healthy dietno sugars or wheat stop masturbating along with watching porn exercise dailyrunning or working out take cold showers daily meditate and limit your amount of time watching tv or being on your phonecomputer all these things can attribute to feeling extremely better and having more energy also try things that will challenge your social anxiety in a positive way but you should definitely go check out nofap,1

nature it does help reducing my social anxiety when i dont watch porn i dont compare myself to other better people and i feel less inferior and therefore less anxious anxiety is mainly triggered by inferiority complexes in my case also when not fapping everyday for hours youll have more time to get social exposure or be in nature which both helps for social anxiety also more energy and slightly higher testosterone levels resulting in less anxiety,1
"run, outside i realised the other day as i was sitting in my roomstraing out my window that the rain is actually my favourite thing in the entire fucking world now whenever it starts raining i run outside and just stand there feeling fucking alive and happy which i never do and when i go to sleep at night i love having my window open and feeling the little sprinkles of water bounce onto my face and smelling that rainy earth smell and listening to it pour down i just love the rain so much this was super detailed ahaha but just know how ya feel ps for context im female",1
walk going for a walk in the rain can be really nice and refreshing so long as im wrapped up tight and dry in it,1
swimming it depends what you mean by fast i think someone can overcome anxiety in a week with the proper environment and full on engagement and commitment if by fast you mean rushing too much to the point of not really working on yourself but rushing into short term fixes then progress will ultimately be slow try to imagine yourself without anxiety what would be the first thing you would want to do or if youd prefer you could answer the question what do you truly enjoy in life this can be anything no matter how small could be a song you like food an activity a person an item of clothing you like to wear a place you like to be doing chores cleaning writing drawing mine would be swimming the weightlessness you feel drifting about in the water and the splashing sounds around me it would be cool to hear what yours would be,1
walk obviously none of us are doctors here but it sounds like you are going through depression it might be a phase idk im lucky enough that when i get depressed by bodybrain automatically bounces back after a week or so ive heard that one of the best ways to help yourself get over it is to pick up some small hobbieschores basically focus on doing something when you get back from school doesnt even need to be anything big you start small like read a few pages of a book clean your bathroom or take a walk andxb,1
Hiking as someone who has suffered from social anxiety i recognise myself in your situation and i think many other people does as wellnnmy first question to you is are you a gamer or do you have other similar time consuming hobbies if you have i recommend you go cold turkey on it until graduation so that you can focus on preparing for the future as well as engaging in activities that will reduce your anxietynnthen i recommend that you try to spend at least half an hour each day you can even use a timer which you dedicate to deciding what you want to do for the future ask yourself what your dream job would be then do research about what you should be doing to to get closer to having that job if having a university education improves your chances of fulfilling your dreams then go for university once you have figured whether you want to study or immediately start working its time to take the necessary steps to achieve your goal research universities you want to apply for research employers you want to work for then rank them according to how attractive they seem this will significantly reduce anxiety as even if you dont get your first option you will likely have dozens of good alternatives on your list you said your grades were good so someone is very likely to accept you nnthen try to figure out what each institutionworkplace requires from you start writing your cv your letter of motivation or whatever else they might need you still have until summer before you graduate and if you spend half an hour per day on these things the time will add upnnregarding your social anxiety there are many techniques you can use to reduce or remove it completely but it does require some work a good first step is always to ask yourself what gives you the most anxiety is it public speaking is it conversations based on your story it sounds like you have anxiety about meeting new people a fear i know all too well the best solution to this is of course to keep meeting new people find out about social activities you can do in your town or neighbourhood is there a sportsclub movieclub hiking group debating society another advice is to build a social anxiety ladder where you will rank your anxieties from least to most anxiety provoking then work yourself up this list start by exposing yourself to situation that only makes your slightly anxious once you feel that you can handle these more easily start on the next item on the listnnalso i need to add that just because you feel anxious around the people in your class doesnt mean that you will feel anxious around other people in the future you said it was fine before you started gymnasium so it is not unlikely that some anxiety are caused by the type of people you hang out with personally i dont interact with most people from my course unless i have to most of my friends are from other courses or from outside of university altogether everyone has certain types of people that they feel more comfortable around eventually you will find your type nngood luck hope it helped a little bit,1
run hahaha i think about of the population thinks they arent attractive im sure you look fine i think a lot of us with social anxiety get stuck in a negative feedback loop i know for me personally girls would like me but i wouldnt make any sort of move because i was nervous so while other people are getting in relationships and you are not its easy to think the reason is that im not attractive enough i use to struggle with this a lot too andxb im married now i met my future wife in the dorm we were living in during college we became close friends for about a year before we finally got involved romantically for me i only really open up and be myself once i get close to someone so i think that is what really helped our relationship andxb i was that you are in therapy but have you tried any medication im on paxil propananol and klonopin and that helped tremendously if you want to stay of prescription medication i also found benadryll and cbd oil to help exercise is probably the best way to help with social anxiety at least in my case i start every day before work with a run or some sort of other aerobic activity and that has made a total difference andxb and man you arent a loser you are going through something that the majority of the people around you will never experience i know how hard it is everyday can be a struggle getting nervous to go to stores classes or even getting on the bus its a daily struggle but you are doing it which i think makes you a hard mother not a loser andxb i know its hard but you have to just continue to put yourself in situations that generally make you feel uncomfortable eventually youll get comfortable being uncomfortable andxb good luck buddy,1
Backpacker I've been telling this to a few people around here applicable in almost all posts I think I know what you mean this sounds obvious but try to get their anxiety a little under control one of my ways is meditating sounds weird I know but actually help not after once but after half a year I really started to see a difference starting tomorrow or tonight half an hour every day you'll learn to control your mind I also walked away from my group of friends for a while I threw myself in the deep backpacker across another country there's no one to judge then even a weekend away could help you feel free to send a message or answer if you have questions be careful,1
"walking, nature doing the same as now taking a good walk in remote nature or going to detect metal if I didn't have sa i could possibly have a friend or partner go with me that would be so big in fact to go on a trip with someone is a fantasy of mine",1
"Out, walk yes totally my neighbors don't like it because sometimes I smoke out near the apartment I know I shouldn't but anyway they just look at me I feel insecure about it and tend to look away so once I woke up and went out for a walk I was sober that rarely I am and made me feel more confident looked my neighbor in the eyes as I passed ahead of him and I was quite relaxed greeted me instead of ignoring me id say it really makes a difference to me",1
"Run, park im feel like you feel that way im and ive had social anxiety and bpd since I was around I feel like I got completely lost in uni and now I have a full-time job where I can't wait to run home and be alone it makes me very sad and every time I push myself out with people I end up getting depressed yesterday I pushed myself to go to a house party away from home and ended up in the smoking social zone my friend is always super safe and noisy sometimes to a very annoying degree I in the other hand just sat on a noded corner and clumsily smoked my cigarette I ended up crying to sleep because I felt so pathetic I told myself today it was a big step for me today I challenge myself to go to a park with a friend I haven't seen in a while and chat just keep giving you little consistent challenges you're not alone",1
walking no need to go to the gym that makes me nervous walking your dog will work long walks calm me too,1
"running wow exactly like me the same age, but macho im was also bullied in school and literally nobody calls me, but even so it's so bad to find music you like to watch series that you want and read books that you want without any feedback from others when you're alone like me around times in a week I'm going to run to release some pressure makes me anxious to run beyond people so my mind just pushes me even faster to escape them I just came to a solution if I can't connect with people that I need to fill that loneliness if I'm not going to get depressed so at least one way to make my well-being a little better I also can't stand social websites like instagram or facebook because of the photo stuff and fake people so I just deleted my accounts don't even have any profile choices on whatsapp just make you feel a little bit better a step at a good time luck",1
Fresh air is fine sometimes the social anxiety is like the last party in the office I went to that it was hard for me to eat and talk so I totally understood I went out to get air I went back and still felt a little strange but the fresh air totally helped if it still feels super uncomfortable just tell them that it doesn't feel good and going home there will be other parties and sometimes if your too much anxiety is good to take a break,1
Walking I think I've overwhelmed my therapist but here the good news is sure to say that social anxiety is just one of my many problems when I told my therapist about my isolation from anger and the history of drug abuse I saw a look in his face as oh shit this guy is seriously in need of some help Theres a positive side to this although I guess to meet him again in two weeks in November my goal is to face a fear every day for two weeks until my next session I started today walking around campus and meeting a stranger who also told me how alone they weren't anything important happened but I started the conversation and broke through the first stage of anxiety I didn't waste any time making the first move today in force for these next two weeks so I can go back to my therapist with news of improvement if you're reading this I know it's hard like hell there when the fear of not facing your fears weighs more than the fear itself than when you find the motivation to change,1
"Walking will pass and get better as always not with social anxiety, but our brains will probably have to relearn some things again too I felt this a little bit a few days too when I was getting some ice cream I felt like the shopkeepers were looking at me maybe there was but their off never in a malicious way as we thought it was but this is something that is a basic task and something live moved past a while ago so I had defto gone a little bit back but their ups and downs always so im trying to keep positive at least going out for a walk every day is allowed and their good for your mind and everyone is out of walking atm as it is the only freedom we get during isolation so if you keep doing that sometimes you have to come through people and at least make eye contact and say hello to them to make it easier and keep things tied up until we get back to normal",1
runner im a runner and I have to say that you're wrong after running I feel fucking great it doesn't completely cure my social anxiety but I definitely feel euphoric and elevated,1
"I was really uncomfortable with him hard with that for years it made me little attractive and other things but I was more afraid to work in a gym and people seeing how fat it was and how I wouldn't do the exercises at that moment im live with him so I didn't do anything then during my last year of school because of the lack of any social life and things I decided I had to do at least something meaningful in my life play programming games and watch physics minutes all day I didn't serve any more time then I started to run every day in the afternoon though the fields where no one could see and bother me more I think I started with km very slower and I only hated much more running and it was very bad in him but at least at the end of the day I had the feeling that id had the more time, I had the more time and time I had the more time and time I had the more time and more time and I had the more time and more time and I had the more time and more I had the more I had the more time and more I had the more time and more I had the more I had the more time and more I had the more time and I had the more I had the more time and I had the more I had the more I had the more time and I had the more I had the more time and I had the more I had the time and I had the time I had the time and I had the time",1

outside don't be afraid to get up and get out if it's not your thing I personally hate to play the same mediocre music without much variation people are drunk and annoying way of self conscious dancing and letting go with friends is sometimes tolerable but then they can pressure you to start dancing and stuff and then I get ultra defensive and close or you can go out and have a breath to cool off if you need to,1
"I don't care how I act and then everything goes wrong but my anxiety amplifies everything that goes wrong and then I keep thinking about it and what's worse to take a walk is a great way to start in a residential place with fewer people and then I move to place with more and more going to cinema cinemas fastfood restaurants conventions also helped me to all the situations in which I had a little bit of anxiety but that lets me see how people act and let me understand a little bit better than one thing you have to do is stop being negative about yourself doesn't seem so negative although you say that anyone who does not bother to read this that looks like your negative reading your thread doesn't bother us we're there to read these threads like any other but it's important that you don't do it much more than you do it, but what most does it is much more, but what's not so much more, and what's more and what's not more, and what's more we don't bother us about is much more than we're not wrong these negatives much more, but what much much more, but what's much more than much more than much more than losing something, but what much, but what's much more, but what's much more, but what's much more and what's much more than, but what's much more than, what's much more and what's much more and what's more and what's more, what's much more than, what's more and what's much more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, and doesn's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more than, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more than, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more, what's more,",1
"Out you have to put yourself out there your easiest saying that fact trusts me I know join a club go to the gym go out more I personally wouldn't try dating online but it's an option to find someone with similar interests there are millions of women in the world thousands that are completely compatible with you im extremely uncomfortable myself but I have found that life is much more rewarding when I challenge myself to become proud even if the first woman you fall in love with rejects should still be proud of yourself ist life always peaches and rainbows and there will be times when your efforts seem to be in vain, but staying strong you don't get to pick up yourself there you deserve love there's someone out there that deserves you so much as you deserve you were brave to publish this that it's some kind of right progress you're making great progress",1
Nature has been doing it very gradually over the past few years yoga and meditation really helps by opening up space in the body and consciously breathing allows more space for different thoughts to enter into your mind also has been doing longer distance running in nature without music just focusing on my breathing and mind has taught me a lot about myself has also been consciously using weed and psychedelic mushrooms to open up more too but id really recommend getting in a good head space through yoga and meditation in order to be more receptive to what the plant can teach me find that as with all that it is important not to stop enjoying plant medicines and allow your body to find its sober balance helps you to get lessons sinked into more following my feelings and focusing more on my own ive interests started to feel more comfortable in my own skin and I have been going to events for myself something that was unimaginable a few years ago and to meet with so many other related pretty people take patience im slowly to reap the benefits of changing my lifestyle,1
park possibly buy something small in a local store my problems are mostly with the crowd and people who don't know very well or read sitting in a crowded park that's nearby lately I've been trying to praise the people around me and I'm starting to see some positive results what was the first activity that started with,1
"I would like to say ive overcome it completely yet, but I feel a lot better now compared to how I was a year ago where I just left my home by myself I would like to think of these things as challengesexperiments for example if you are afraid to walk the streets by yourself start by walking around the neighborhood where you still feel slightly anxious but much safer and keep doing until you feel like there is no more threat then go for bigger things then you have phone anxiety then mark strangers on purpose and act stupid then say you have the wrong number and hang up if you want to talk freely to a group of people around for example try to express yourself when there are only people for example you know baby steps I also tried to neutralize my anxious thoughts if an anxious thought would suddenly happen about a upcoming event I would try to calm myself down and say something like maybe it won't be as bad as I think wrong to do better this time I can not get to worry about what sometimes I have done this wrong before and I want to do well my next life I would like to die mantras such as I am completely independent of the good and bad opinion of others that I will also I care more about myself and I care more I care more about myself and I care more than I care about myself and I do it sometimes I care more than I care about myself and I care about myself and I do it myself and I do it myself because I care more I do it myself because I want to do it myself",1
"Jogs, walk is fine at least you know that your perception of love is not realistic loneliness will never go away despite getting a meaningful man unless you get to a point where you're happy with yourself at least reduce your smoke consumption less drink more water and go to jogswalks more often if you follow this will be substantially beneficial man the only way you can get completely on the way to progress is to forgive yourself to be self-compassionate your good to make mistakes as long as we use them as passing stones to keep writing you don't have to be nabakov or charles dikens to start taking baby steps instead of waiting for full recovery from yourself in an instant one thing that kind of fact with social anxiety and depression was to go to shit why I care too much about thinking that the world will end finally and nothing will matter from these people are anything in the big scheme of things that I'm nothing like as I have nothing to lose in everything that I want to do without this fear I have the right to live in this short life im i I can i can i that there's no time in your eyes really how I want to have nothing in the great scheme of things I want nothing to lose in all that I don't really",1
"walk, outdoors, park go out for a walk once a day additionally and slowly start to increase the time you spend out try to go to a different route every time it is not to cause too much stress if you live in a larger city or city go shopping instead of buying online call some businesses and just ask random questions about your product start going to a bar at first during the week later on weekends too you don't have to talk to people just take a drink and then go home after half an hour start doing sport either outdoors or in a gym if you trust her to talk to your friend about her problems if you can try to take your dog to a dog park or something so try to make small conversations with the other dog owners these are just some ideas, but please take it easy and don't overload the key is to slowly expand your comfort zone and your optimal performance area without entering into the area of danger ideally would do it under the supervision of a professional like a therapist if the topic is interesting so that looking for exposure therapy I hope you could help",1
"hiking, running yes but those thoughts have been improving recently you can be alone and still be happy for me personally I love hiking reading running etc no matter if I do all those things alone make me happy and I'm happy to make them find a hobby you can enjoy and then enjoy it no matter who comes together ironically to dedicate myself to personal hobbies has made it a little easier to talk to people if anyone ever asks about me I can talk about my hobbies talking about hobbies seems to be much easier than discussing my personal or professional life than kind of sucking",1
"out, walking, running a thing that really helped me out and around people going on walks around a trail was terrifying the first few times, but then I realized that nobody really cared that I was there is an easier and understandably difficult thing to start doing if you feel uncomfortable being around people even when there's no need to talk I tend to get anxious every time people can see me I liked the trails with a lot of turns so I wasn't constantly in people's eyes, but once I got used to it I had to force myself a couple of times I went to different paths that had a straighter way for a change of scenery their something alive made for a year and a half now that I really enjoyed doing multiple times a week I feel it for any mistake that I didn't really comment on things",1
Im day care close to your age and have had two jobs so far my social anxiety is very overwhelming but I realize that I need money to improve my life in the long term i.e. college rent funds etc. so here are some personal tips and volunteers local pet shelters are great for this because they accept all those who are willing and not a crazy trying to skin cats this will introduce them into the social work environment and if they are offered in a cloth shop or in a garden center something very small will help your anxiety my first job was in Walmart in the product section the worst they have to do is someone who asks you where the oranges are while they are allowed out an email in practice are much more popular than working at school and they call you to their first interview you can have a time to reschedule and ask questions about your time after one day you have to go back to your phone like anxiety so they are not allowed to leave a voice office that is never called to the university and you can make an interview time in the interview and you can make your phone,1
I think this is kind of a success that has suffered from social anxiety for many years and as a result have almost just hidden away at home this has made my social skills even worse to the point that even struggles with being around family members and I no longer have any friends who can see in person a year old boy without work experience and very few life skills this needs to change so this past month I have been doing more of an effort to improve things and I hope this is the beginning of me becoming more and more socially comfortable I recently started to see a support worker and she helped me to go out more together we have been exploring my local area and I am used to walking and generally being out of this has led to why im doing this post today I have recently joined a surprised gym I have always wanted to improve my fitness but lacking the motivation and initiative to do it at home is why I imagined that joining a gym would make sense because I would also force myself out more regularly your almost red and I have an introductory meeting at the gym in the hospicium im feelinging quite nervous and very tempted to avoid it the last day is lucky and I hope that I would not have a meeting on the day and I would have a meeting more regularly their almost red,1
"Out, walk, park definatley social anxiety bro the best advice you could give is to start using your microphone in video games to talk to people build their social skills with random people in video games and once you have developed your social skills enough where you are safe and then get out more go for a walk in the park go to the library or find something else to do you are forced to engage in conversation with random people maybe not right away, but eventually the best of luck",1

"Backpacker I think I know what you mean this sounds obvious, but trying to get your anxiety a little under control one of my ways is meditating sounds weird, but it really doesn't help after once, but after half a year I really started to see a difference starting tomorrow or tonight half an hour every day you'll learn to control your mind I also ran away from my group of friends for a while I threw myself in the backpacker depth across another country there's no one to judge then even a weekend away could help you feel free to send a message or answer if you have questions be careful",1

running yeah my anxiety can be really exacerbated by the weeds ive found that if I have something and do yoga or exercise I go deeper into my practice and it's really beneficial but if I sit and watch TV while im high makes the anxiety so bad ive had some rather bad panic attacks while standing up from time to time I do guided meditations but mostly I just do yoga and running has become a moving meditation practice for me too I put hz and frequency music and just sit down with myself and its amazing what can come there a lot of different meditation methods I guess it's just about finding a way that resonates with you more,1

"I'm not kidding, but I would say cold showers push-ups, move your body collides with something positive, for example cold water, obviously you want to live on some level, so remember why it's reminding you that you have a heart pumping blood into your veins and you're alive right now sounds like you're in a dark hole at the time and you've been in one too for many years, but the way out of that hole is not to talk to people on the Internet. I'm not hard. to be serious, but nothing will change until you change the messages you're saying. I can't fix anything positive.

Walk im also went through a period of a month in which I didn't leave the house at all and when I did it was early morning or late pm to drip the grocery store the best advice I can give is to take it in baby steps first just try to take a minute on fast foot until the end of your street and back once you're comfortable with making it a little longer maybe walk to a nearby store without necessarily going in until you feel comfortable,1

"out, bike, sun totally worth man not even a question is hard to tell you what to do, but what I'm going to say is that I definitely don't think about it your whole challenge but the reward of being totally cool and quiet when you're there exceeds the effort of the next few weeks here the part where I mention all the things I could be doing to make it easier your mind to read go out of exercise and we've all heard this spiel and know how great they are all but they're probably great things that you can do during these two weeks and why not really read will occupy your mind while keeping you focused even entertained and going on a bike ride on a good day feels so good in the sun trust me man change your life for a little bit to see what it's like to be where you want to be putting in more effort on myself and your has been great really don't get used to that every day being a normal new then what used to be is progress",1

"park, walk I hate to tell you what you already know, but rehearsal and error is the best way of exposure therapy something I did for the first time when I started trying to improve my sa was to go to my local park and just go for walks I made a point to smile and nod everyone that I passed and finally gave a verbal salute there or hey I won't forget how difficult it was at the time and how far it comes because those days so bars and clubs don't really vibrate with you are my thing unless someone invites me but there are other points of sale if you have a local card store or table game store I would bet that you have weekly meetings and play mtg or monopoly this kind of places tend to attract a multitude of people with sa and as sure you can never guess that they are very welcoming people who also spend a lot of time with my sisters that honestly I can call my best friends who have helped me tremendously with my saive have a long way to go as you yourself with sa and as sure as they have never been in a relationship that they don't let me down through their daily struggle but trying to be very positive and very proud to be in a place that they do they do they do they do they know what they do they do they know what they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do it and what they do they do they do they do it and they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do what they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do what they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do what they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do they do",1

"Out yes as a side note don't tell your son that you are being rude for being quiet or my family are amazing selfless people of the time, but there was a day in my adolescence now when I felt quite uncomfortable because there were a few other people in the house and I made a point of going out with my sister instead of where it was less overwhelming I was later told by a fairly irritated family member how rude I was being to stay out of the way it was pure lack of understanding on her part she and the whole world are much more aware of my sa now but it really hurts me at the time because there was nothing I could do to change what I felt around others and the comment stayed with me in some ways made me even more hyperaware of how other people are perceiving me because I don't want them to think rude im and their always in the back of my mind",1

"nature maybe trying to find a hobby I bought a second hand d printer and have a lot of things to do with collecting metal detection made me come out in nature at least once a week exposure to sunlight increases levels of serotonin hobbies can fill a part of the vacuum pretty well not a perfect substitute by any means, but it seemed to me that it helped break the habit of weed weeds still very lonesome and failed im in life, but my hobbies offer me a glimpse of hope I still enjoy the things I have listed from time to time, but it is not an addiction imo and I try to avoid spending too much time that way",1
"Go take a walk to keep your notes and make peace and try to turn your mind off for a little bit honestly not think about what not to think about all that helps to sit on a chair close your eyes and focus on your breathing so that you can slow down then move your focus from your feet to your legs to your back all the way to your head and try to really feel the way your feet are in your shoes touch the ground how the back of your thighs is touching the chair, etc. Ketera is a way of mindfulnessning this for some time allows you to say minutes make up then get out of that hotel room and take your notes with you go for a walk try to focus on your senses the smells the winds and the possible temperature the sun burning your skin may not read your notes a little while walking offers you the opportunity to still read it but focus your attention on something more at the same time I hope that this will help good luck and even if something you anticipated that is not a bad thing and not the end of the world your just a maximum minute will pass",1
"parkour link from another post made me feel like I would like to get a little enjoyment of socializing that would help lift my mood make me lively and not so robotic that it would also allow me to do more hobbies that could be more based on society or public as parkour free running trick bboying popping and other kinetic forms of expression that I would get to go where all the artists are and interact with them exposure to that world with people of mind etc. I am having difficulty articulating this, but ultimately I would breathe in life I feel so empty right now",1

And I couldn't stop thinking that everyone hated me and I was weird even no one was like that to me and when I had social anxiety years ago in school when I started people I sat away from my friends I usually say next to school and I was wondering what to do and they said to me that I could only talk to people and social anxiety I literally ruined my life every night that I was going to be friends with a lot of people and go out to be pathetic and distance my own people from every school except that a few close friends would tell me to myself and they would tell me that they hated me and they thought that I could only make the bus to school a nightmare for me every night that I went like sleep hours except for the weekends and that I would make the whole night that I didn't go to school that I was going to school that I was going to the street and that I was going to the street and that I was going to the street and to the street and to the street with that I was going to the street and to the street and the street that I was going to the street,1

"running, run I feel like this most of the time too but ive note it helps when I focus on improvable skills I beat up about not be charismatic enough or smart enough but you know what I can improve on performing piano writing painting etc has been very good for my self-esteem focusing on activities like these is like that cliché saying that just focusing on being better than you were yesterday except your true type lol your certainly isn't something that comes naturally but when you start setting goals and meeting them your incredibly rewarding and healthy live never felt particularly good at anything, but now I can say that I run and that's better than nothing",1
", park ill try to give some tips, but take it as it will be enough at the bottom of the rock to say here I'll be like I try to think about it I know my weaknesses and strengths for example im good at staying in my house all day isolating me in my im bad room in my social skills if your little talk asking for directions making friends ec wrong I'm going to make a list of things in a spectrum through what is easier and what it is the worst to talk worse to a random girl on the street seeing easier maybe going into the bookstore to check the most recent book selection once you discover the problems is much easier to dissect how to solve it and since bad im in all the bad thing has to learn from the bottom idk if this is a real date but everything in life is a skill all you need is determination and practice to become a teacher of circumstances that we don't dominate socializing as children are supposed to happen socializing is a skill that is going to be known in the practice of the most difficult things, maybe you'll go to see more of life or even the mood that you won't dominate socializing even happen very well",1

executing second this execution or any physical activity that you like really helps me put things into perspective I think being around people that makes anxiety go crazy really messes with my priorities I really don't want to care what others think just what I think of myself and when I'm around people and so self-conscious I become someone who molds myself to what others need that I don't like running really helps me re-establish this mentality after being around people for a long time,1

"walking dirt and breathing techniques work for some people prefer to listen to music giving a walk or a bath, etc. doing an activity you enjoy can sometimes take your mind from your worries, but I personally understand that thoughts can get overwhelming no matter what you are doing work little by little to relax will help you master the ability in my experience as an anxious person could not just immediately relax your time to find out what works by testing some things maybe make a list of what you like to do or Google relaxation techniques and try to take note of the way it makes you feel and try to implement some techniques in your daily schedule",1

swimming depends on what you mean quickly I think someone can overcome anxiety in a week with the right environment and full of commitment and commitment if by fast you mean to rush too much to the point of not really working on yourself but rushing into short-term corrections then progress will finally be slow to try to imagine yourself without anxiety what would be the first thing you want to do or if you prefer to answer the question what you really enjoy in life this can be anything no matter how small a song can be that you like eating an activity a person a clothing item that you like to wear a place that you like to do cleaning tasks my drawing would be swimming the weightlessness that you feel drifting in the water and the sounds splashing around me would be great to hear what would be yours would be,1

How to meet someone who has suffered social anxiety I recognize myself in your situation and I think that many other people ask the first question to you are you a player or have another similar time consuming hobbies if you have recommended going cold turkey at it until graduation so that you can focus on preparing for the future as well as participating in activities that will reduce your anxietyanthen I recommend you try to have a future job if having a college education improves your chances of fulfilling your dreams gives the university what you are dedicated to deciding what you want to do for the future will ask you what your dream job would be then do research on what you should do to get closer to having that job than research employers you want to work to make it easier gives you to the university what you do to your business will let you know if you want to study or immediately start working your time to achieve your goal universities that you want to apply to your research employees that you would like to apply to research employers that would like to work for what matters to you will matter a long time you will care about yourself,1
I think that many of us with social anxiety get stuck in a negative feedback loop I know for myself girls personally I would like but I wouldn't do any kind of movement because I was nervous so while other people are getting into relationships and it's not easy to think that the reason is that im not attractive enough use to fight with this much too yxb im married now I met my future wife in the bedroom where we lived during college we became close friends for about a year before we finally got romantically involved for me just really open up and be myself once I get close to someone so I think that's what really helped our relationship yxb that it was also that you're in therapy but you've tried any im medication in paxil propanol and klonopin and that it helped tremendously if you want to stay on prescription drugs it seems to me that I also found that blessryll and cbd oil to help the mother do a hard job that makes you easier and that people who makes you easier and easier than you can do in life makes you easier and easier than you can make it easier.,1

Jogging if you're looking for the light you'll find it if you're looking for the dark is all you're going to see in my first semester of college I've tried a lot to overcome my sa while I ended up making progress it wasn't as fast as I had hoped and I still had a lot of problems doing some things like jogging in public I ended up getting quite depressed and the next two semesters were quite failures as I lost my motivation I was finally able to get back on my feet again in part because I was forced to interact with some people in a project group it's not something that you can quickly overcome it's something that you have to overcome step by step and inch and there will be setbacks but that it's okay to focus on the little wins like really going to a club instead of the little failures not being able to talk,3

social anxiety on the way to recovery social anxiety is a terrible mental health disorder having suffered from it as I was I understand how debilitating it can be just going out and how fear before just making it the simplest of tasks can make it feel like I am doing this post because although I know that this subreddit tends to be mainly memes and jokes and I love that we all share a common thing that we all suffer from social anxiety and for many this post will be useless but when I first subscribe to this subreddit id never did anything significant to address and deal with my mental health I had a feeling of hopelessness that I no longer have and if I could come back in time and give these words to myself I would like to have the self-control to make your health easier than I have met a girl in the last year that I have faced with going to college but I need a future that she needs to get a better social education than better than I would have people of social education and what you have more difficult than education than what you have more difficult than what you have to do than you have to do than make education more difficult to do education and education and education.,3
"On foot, running makes someone get paranoid with more than one car driving behind you. I just got my student permit in May at age. I’ve been slowly pushing myself. First I started driving literally down the block and back on a quiet side street. My second time I drove on a longer but still quiet side street and back third time I drove in the evening around pm with my mom and went to the roads with street lights. But I stayed close to my house. Fourth time at the time of the afternoon. I drove by myself and drove further than before. I drove a few times after that. But I want to get to my main point, as with most of you. I hate large groups of people when I see someone walking behind me on the same side of the street.",3

I'm not sure how this is supposed to help of course never said this to any therapist because well I don't want to risk frustrating them lol but there was even a couple of times where I went out with a therapist and I practiced just being anxious in public that sucked and told me that after doing this enough times I should finally feel better but I want to say that I go out every day and I've been doing my whole life just to feel terrible every day so I don't really know the point of all this I'm sorry if this is really negative I'm basically asking for a more hopeful perspective on all of this or maybe some advice as to what more to try if someone has some im aware that some people here complain that this sub is too negative so I was afraid to publish this but anything I was roasted if you should a little desperate for some hope that I want to change but I still have a negative perspective on life and all that maybe there's someone else out there that can interrupt my brain negative lecture negative to me,3
Out of social anxiety is ruining my life I'm a one-year-old woman and I've always been shy I grew up living in the same place throughout middle and high school elementary school so I've always had the same friends and I never needed to make new ones then when I went to college for myself I really fought and I never could make friends I'm so uncomfortable around the world except my parents and I don't know what to do overthink everything even say hello to a stranger I just get scared just like I'm constantly being judged what makes me feel so anxious every time I leave my home everyone says that college is one of the best moments of their life and I would like to enjoy my time in college but I have no idea how to start a conversation with someone without being completely uncomfortable I've been in college for years now and my day consists of going to my classes and not talking to anyone and then going back to my bedroom to watch movies and do school work since I'm constantly alone I feel very sad sitting in my bedroom myself but then I feel sad when I go outside and all the other friends have a good idea of having a good time to have fear,3
"Out, I can't walk out anymore listening to cars and people talking out listening to my neighbors coming in and out of their apartments always gives me anxiety I have avoid personality disorder so he says I avoid any possible contact with other human beings currently I don't have clean clothes because I'm afraid to go to the laundry I was about to go I was happy to get clean clothes but when I had to leave I stood there having to walk miserable minutes to get there having to face people who look at me noticing that I exist and possibly judging myself is too much for me too I have nothing to eat but I'm afraid to go to my local grocery store because I've been going there a lot recently what if the cashier judges me to buy a lot of sick food I just have to wait until Sunday when there's no one out to go to the laundry and go to another grocery store im so tired my social anxiety is so bad that I's preventing me from living a normal life im constantly worrying about bs can tell me that it gets better",3
"Running, walking too much running is really fun but I can't get over the idea that someone looks at me and judges me for running weird or not being very athletic or even because I'm running I can be comfortable walking in public now because I tell myself that it's normal and everyone is doing it but I can't do that for running even when I'm about to miss a train that stops running if someone can see me lol",3
outside I miss the times that I got almost euphoric about being able to sit in front of my computer the rest of the day after being out for so long I miss the dopamine that my brain gave me after being exhausted from riding bikes with friends all day and I could rest by playing video games why you have to ruin everything sa,3

", park what is this xpost ranxiety decides to put this here because I only have an answer here I feel like a kind of impostor here I haven't been diagnosed with anything but I know there's something wrong with me where to start so I think I could be described as a quiet shy introvert I know that being shy and introverted are two different things and reserved person I've always been so far at least im goes a little further though it's incredibly uncomfortable socially and I really don't know what to say if a conversation dies I feel like all my guilt because it's not interesting i stay avoid skype calls with a close friend numerous times because of this and I feel like every time you decline a request to call me my friend as they hate me or something even though I know it's strange I also have friends I've been known online i keed ween ween ween ween ween ween ween ween ween ween ween ween ween ween ween ween ween ween ween ween ween ween ween ween ween ween",3
"bike, walking is every time I look someone in the eye when I'm on my bike or when I'm walking somewhere I feel like they look at me and ridicule me in their heads as they judge me even in that fraction second they see me I know that my low confidence is the reason for this, but then I start to be anxious and hate myself for being so insecure because im boy years and has often been told im good look",3
"walk, outside do I have social anxiety I'm not sure if I have social anxiety or I'm just introverted here are some things about me when I'm walking out in public without a friend I get self-conscious and anxious what makes me walk faster and take routes with less busy streets my main fear when I im in public is that I'm going to know or be noticed by someone I know I make false assumptions about myself depending on my location and situation, for example if someone sees me walking in a bad neighborhood im afraid that they assume a criminal when I'm in public with a friend yet it's much easier and I get less anxious I get crazy when I'm called by the teacher to read or present in front of the class when my class is taking turns reading aloud I'll give your friends quickly sneak out in the paragraph before everyone else gets ready to read the next one when I introduce myself to the class cake and I can't keep my body still move my hands over the hours of wearing clothes i feed to wear fear to the fear of other",3

beach duuuude I feel so hard that I've been hoping someone would post about it because I'm not the best in words things im an attractive f with pretty bad not terribly bad social anxiety I feel like since attractive people don't expect it to be so fucking weird and you're absolutely right about expectations it also sucks when you're good at something and attractive and you want to do it in public but you feel anxious because people will think you're showing or something that obviously I can't read people's minds but I'm pretty sure that's what they're thinking I love yoga and do hand stops and what I don't but I can't feel comfortable doing it in public myself as on the beach or something because people will start thinking things and I just want to do it in peaceeeeeeeee agh so they're totally giving you and im so happy that other people have this problem p,3
